3,"Did I just finish one of the most tearjerker time traveller films of all time at 2 am? Yes.“We are all travelling through time together, everyday of our lives. What we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.”This was a rollercoaster of emotions. It’s such a lovely film. I loved every moment of it. There were plot holes that would have been better if explained further, but everything about this film will make you…"
4,"El secreto de la felicidad está en los detallesUn hombre que puede viajar en el tiempo usa su talento para conquistar al amor de su vidaEmotiva, sencilla, originalUna película tierna, dulce y divertida, excelente para pasar un momento en pareja o en familia, a diferencia de muchos melodramas, tiene una historia muy original, creativa, y con un buen grado de profundidad.Maneja un ambiente clásico pero muy bien adaptado de los melodramas, con constantes toques de humor…"

7,"Isn't this the point of life? Going through everyday living and feeling your emotions to the fullest, is the real superpower any human needs. Oh don't forget to love and be loved <3"
8,"ive just watched the most amazing film ever (imo). ive never been this broken after watching a film in my life. ive never cried this much after a film😭 (i might never recover). a film about a time traveling protagonist trying to get a girlfriend is such a silly premise, but it sucker punches u out of nowhere. halfway through u leave a lighthearted, goofy romantic comedy and ur transported to a deep, emotional, and moving film that hits u…"

31,domhnall gleeson it’s so hot in this
32,"bárbaro, no se como no conocía esta película pero agradezco haberla conocido mi ultima día de clases en la universidad porque el significado es mucho más profundo"
33,dispenso comentários
34,Ben Folds has made an immeasurable contribution to cinema between the Over the Hedge soundtrack and his needle drop in this movie
35,“About time” that I saw this😉😬🥵🤪😈
36,my fave I want to live in this universe
37,Panget to kapag may nakawatch party ka. Mago-ghost ka bigla
38,"que filme lindo sinceramente, eu não tenho palavras para descrever como é bonito, a relação de pai e filho mexeu de uma forma absurda comigo, não tem como não amar cada detalhe"

45,eu nunca vou me cansar desse filme nunca em toda minha vida meudeus do ceu que coisa maravilhosa
46,I hate these time travel rules
47,esse filme é muito bom
48,I’m just here for Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams
49,We’re just not gonna acknowledge how creepy it is and honestly I’m not mad about it
50,This is my second time watching it and I remember it being really sweet and heart warming and I did not enjoy it this time. They said prostitute 30x. Not one of the times was funny. I don’t like rating movies I don’t like but I made max watch this and he asked me to write a review. BOOOOOOO
51,The main character is genuinely so scary in the first part of this movie… the wife character is the most like man vision of how a fun lil romantic lead should act… the time travel makes no fucking sense… every character is paper thin… they use the same stupid piano theme after every scene… the fact that this movie is as highly rated as it is blows my mind.
52,about time for me to get a girlfriend fuk
53,pega diferente verla el último día de clases de la universidad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
54,domhnall gleenson is never beating the weasley allegations
55,Only reason why I didn’t put 5 stars is because I was not warned that I would cry during this
56,"Like Adam Sandler’s Click, but British and ten times worse"
57,"se a palavra ""carinho"" fosse um filme"
58,Give me a better soundtrack and it’s five stars
59,i ... feel robbed of my time
60,que filme mais lindo!! queria muito ter o autocontrole que o Tim teve quando a margot robbie tava dando em cima dele
61,this movie had me sobbing. i should probably call my dad
62,i won’t cry anymorealways a good reminder of your life and happiness
63,"que roteiro, um roteiro digno de filme com viagem no tempo. esse filme é um filmaço de romance com viagem no tempo, ainda faz você realmente pensar sobre a vida e sobre aproveitar cada milésimo de segundo do seu tempo. sem falar que faz você pensar toda hora em como você gostaria de voltar no tempo em vários momentos da sua vida que você se arrependeu. um elenco incrível, personagens carismáticos e roteiro digno, sem falar da comédia que super funcionou. esse filme eh completamente PERFEITO, traz varias lições muito preciosas, super recomendo!!"
64,i’m sobbing i didn’t think i would sob
65,"Still love this movie, the ending with the day is just 🤌🏼🤧"
66,Aww :)
67,"One of my favorite movies! It is not just about love but also has the story of family. It is very heartwarming, and I really love the relationship that they have."
68,"Um dos melhores filmes sobre relações humanas e relacionamentos reais. A temática da viagem no tempo fica em segundo plano e o que se destaca são as interações entre os personagens, principalmente o romance fora do óbvio entre os protagonistas, que mesmo diante das dificuldades encontraram beleza e força em construir uma vida juntos."
69,não ironicamente pensei que ia gostar bem menos(camila já pode soltar a faca
70,supeeer super super laku noć#minarecs
71,I wish
72,"it’s crazy because i started this film cringing a little and really not wholly invested at all (time travel? going into cupboards? what?) and yet by the end of it i did cry. i don’t think i expected it to be as accessible in certain ways as it was, since it’s basically less about these individuals (cannot relate to tim very much myself) but rather time itself and how it can warp things, so in the end it’s better to…"
73,best movie of its genre
74,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Can’t be rejecting Margot like that.
75,I think when it comes to Romcoms - Richard Curtis is my guy. Where do I even fault this beautiful masterpieceI laughed. I cried. This is how it’s done.I don’t care if it’s “soppy” or “unrealistic”. This is what I signed up for.Unbelievable acting supported by my idea of a perfect script.I think I want to marry Mary
76,um dos melhores filmes de romance de todos os tempos
77,I 😭😭😭😭 LOVE 😭😭😭 LOVE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
78,"I cried really hard at the end, I don’t want my dad to go :("
79,"""I just try to live every day as if I've deliberately come back to this one day, to enjoy it, as if it was the full final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life."""
80,What a heartwarming movie🥹 I loved everything about this!
81,"i really enjoyed watching this movie. it doesn't require me to think too much but still interesting to watch. sad but totally heartwarming to see. absolutely love the father-son relationship portrayed in this movie, have never really seen a bond like that irl."
82,Another good watch with the wife. 😌
83,Fofos e reflexivo
84,Noice
85,uncle desmond.
86,Only true cinephiles notice that he paid an absurd amount for that meal deal and didn't even get a third item
87,Me quiero morir.
88,This hurt
89,About Time is just so fucking good isn't it. I watched this recently around April time and I resonated with the film so much that I decided to rewatch it only 2 months later. Well it's safe to say this film is still as good as it was previously.I noticed a lot more in this film the second time round that I didn't notice on first watch. I resonated with the characters much more and it only really sunk…
90,thank you for ruining my life
91,I aspire to be as cool as Tim’s mom
92,Now I don’t want time travel powers
93,will never not watch this movie
94,Ug best movie ever made. I wish love was real.
95,"This is what I needed today, do you think that he could live forever? I mean he does have the ability to travel back in time, he only needs to live in dark area, speaking if it’s a planned death."
96,ahhhh it’s so cute how can u not love it
97,I forgot how much I love this movie🥹
98,por algún motivo me encanta estar viva
99,"cute movie, a little cheesy. i like the direction of the third act, bill nighy rules!"
100,Enjoyable and wholesome film. Made me smile thorough out.
101,LOVELY MOVIE i cried
102,Wonderful! Rom coms can go terribly wrong but this one is just great! It’s funny and witty and the cast is really really good! Quiet emotional and just the whole concept too like I’m quiet a fan of “time travel” movies Domnhall was hilariously funny in this and you get to see Rachel half naked so win win if u ask me Great film
103,Liv movie if ever there was one
104,tom hollander played the best and most likable unlikable asshole of all time
105,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  EU QUERO AMAR E SER AMADO VO ME MAT
106,super ganda potangina
107,uncle desmond>>>
108,why was i sitting here grinning and chuckling away as if i was the one with rachel mcadams
109,ดีมากๆๆๆๆ ฮืออออออ ไม่รู้จะพูดอะไรนอกจากดีมาก คาแรคเตอร์แทบทุกคนน่ารัก พระเอกน่ารัก นางเอกน่ารัก สุดยอดมากจริงๆ
110,About time I watched this again
111,This was supposed to make me feel better like it normally does. It did not
112,why is it giving himym vibes in the best possible way
113,"Great, gets less because of the final monologue."
114,"volver a ver esta película después de tanto, con la persona que amo al lado, experiencia 10/10. 🩷"
115,You have to be a sentimental idiot to look past the plot holes and unpleasantness in the romancing section of this but fuck me dead I am a god damn moron and so into this.
116,i would pay to get my memory erased just to watch this movie for the first time again
117,"I mean it was cute, but isn't kinda creepy to obsess over someone like that?"
118,A cena da praia continua a ser das melhores cenas da história do cinema.
119,MARGOT ROBBIE AND RACHEL MCADAMS IN ONE MOVIE ?!?!?!?!?!?!
120,Really love this movie
121,"la vi por primera vez en un autobús de viaje a la playa, desde ahí la he visto como 8 veces, la amo, me hace llorar siempre"
122,"for some reason, i couldn't find a good stream of Can't Buy Me Love, so I depressingly watched this instead."
123,So much more than the simple romcom I was expecting. The amount of love in every second of it was astounding and Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan portrayals have this profound understanding of life. I think Richard Cordery’s performance as Uncle Desmond at the funeral is what finally broke me.
124,Comfort movie
125,Ang lungkot pala magkaroon ng tatay buti na lang wala ako
126,"La he visto mil veces, mil veces me vuelve a encantar. Vivir el presente, disfrutar los pequeños placeres, el valor de lo efímero."
127,"Es que ni se que decir de esta película, pero que lindo el amor y como cada persona lo interpreta o siente de diferentes maneras. “True love last a lifetime”"
128,"“all time traveling in the world can’t make someone love you” muy linda película, no me recordaba lo linda que era"
129,this movie altered the trajectory of my life the first time i watched it
130,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This movie frustrated me because it ended on such a good note. But to me there’s so many plot holes and the main character is pretty annoying in the fact that he just gets to be a creep and cheat his way through life. Margot Robbie is a plus though
131,ok well shit… Daisy was right.
132,Domhnall Gleeson needs his respect. Such an underrated actor. This movie was so good and so beautiful.
133,um dos filmes mais lindos que já vi
134,You would think this movie would be shit but it’ll get you every. Single. Time.
135,que comédia romântica são essas que me fazem chorar
136,barely passed the bechdel test
137,THE FRINGE IS THE BEST BIT!!!!!
138,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   at times it was beautiful, inspiring, & made me rethink my life and appreciate it more, but i was mostly just annoyed by this movie LOL. barely any of the humor worked for me and i found a lot of the characters just not very likeable ?? even the main two ? im kind of disappointed by this a little. smh. + every decision domnhall gleeson made for the first half of this movie felt like the absolute wrong one. like…"
139,esse ruivo é um manipular!!!! prendam esse homem a vida inteira dele é baseada em mentiras e MESMO assim ele não volta no tempo pra ficar rico esquerdomacho é foda até na ficção
140,to everyone that advertised this movie as a cute romcom. you are cruel.
141,Llore horas
142,The real crime is choosing between Rachel McAdams and Margot Robbie.
143,this is how I want my life to feel like
144,should rewatchsome parts felt sooo long but it’s a comfort film
145,ai vou sempre lembrar de voltar pra reassistir esse
146,i honestly don’t need to write a review but i just want everyone to know this is my favorite movie of all time and if you haven’t watched it you need to ok byeeeee
147,"i just really didn't like this movie.i'm not a fan of movies where its just entirely the male gaze (random scenes of rachel mccadams stripping, her entire character just existing to be a mother and have sex with him, him using his power of time travel to have sex with her over and over and over, the tent for the wedding party collapsing from rain causing water to conveniently fall all over the womens shirts (who also happen to…"
148,"Im surprised i've never heard about this movie!Great movie very sweet, made me cry but only a little bit and not of sadness but because of a moment that is bittersweet.-----If i had a penny for everytime rachel mcadams played the love interest of a time traveler id have three pennies. Which isnt many but its strange it happened three times"
149,Una película la cual puede mostrar un amor muy sinceró
150,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  no way bill weasley pulled margot robbie and rachel mcadams in one movie
151,filme triste e feliz ao mesmo tempo amei
152,c'est ce qu'on appelle un très beau film ^^
153,im so fucking devastated
154,if you get to the second half this movie becomes more than bearable
155,AMOOOOOO 💕
156,"this is ridiculous. what if i want to travel to the sahara? i mean i’m not a professional but as far as i know, there aren’t any closets in the sahara.also i th"
157,Great romantic sci-fi. What Yesterday wanted to be.
158,esse é um dos poucos filmes que sempre me faz chorar
159,malditasea como me hace llorar
160,hijueputa como lloré cuando murió el papá
161,"Yeah it’s lovely, surprisingly poignant and probably Richard curtis’s best film but it’s slightly fucked up to think that you could slightly tweak it and it essentially becomes a horror movie about Rachael mcadams  discovering that her life is being controlled by a manipulative time traveller. Still…….yay romance?"
162,"Well the film left me with a lot of emotion. In retropect some of the twee tone annoyed me a little, and the female characters I thought were a bit male gazey throughout. However despite it ostensibly being a rom com, by far the strongest and most emotional part is the father/son relationship. With Bill Nighy and Brendan Gleeson giving a standout performance."
163,I zoned out halfway through this movie. I really want to get wingstop. Idk why but that’s all I could think about. I cannot tell you what happened in the second half at all but first half was a solid 3 😋
164,"Film che non avrei mai scelto di vedere dal poster. Come si dice, non giudicare mai i film dalla copertina... per fortuna un cengone del passato lo aveva messo nella watchlist, non ricordo neanche più perché.Insomma alla fine dà molto più di quello che ci si aspetta.Paradossi temporali a bizzeffe ma anche tantissimo romanticismo sulla vita."
165,This movie is so sweet I just love it so much🤧
166,Baba sahneleri beni ağlatmıştır
167,Wow quel film je m’y attendais pas
168,dios la voy a ver mil veces y cada una de ellas voy a llorar
169,por esta película es que quiero un romance
170,"Sommige films breken je echt, lekker gehuild. Toch heel mooi ook en laat me altijd weer even appricieren hoe mooi het leven ook is. Ook met de slechte momenten etc..."
171,No words can express how perfect this film is
172,"The most well-scripted and featuring the most empathetic characters I have ever seen in a film. Bill Nighy as Tim's father was a profound choice; his calm wisdom and sarcastic humor make him feel so human and loving. His relationship with Tim is definitely my favorite of the whole movie, as it is magically nostalgic. Pun intended, as they share similar moments in time multiple times together -- that just makes their connection more relatable. Family movies like these always…"
173,too many gingers
174,Tough choice between Rachel Adams and Margot Robbie ngl.Fun plot and engaging pacing.Romance7/10
175,‘I’m so good without the ball’ -Davey Jones to general Hux
176,so very british
177,favorite film of all time
178,new comfort film :(
179,love is real
180,on wednesday’s we travel back in time
181,This movie revealed to me that I no longer like romantic movies
182,i love this movie for making me cry so hard 😭
183,well that was amazing. I will now not be able to get over the walk on the beach. sort of hit every emotion really. beautiful film.
184,"THIS MOVIE IS SWEETTT, OH TO HAVE HIS POWER"
185,Me and who? Might actually be my fav movie ever (the last 15 minutes made me cry)
186,My like 4/5th watch and the end still gets me every time. One of my favs. Also the soundtrack fits so well.
187,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  why do i do this to myselfthis is one of the very few films that can make me sob as hard as i did the first time i watched it.the day bill nighy actually dies is the day i die.
188,still amazing
189,I don’t know why I keep rewatching this because it just fucking wrecks me every time my god
190,"the soundtrack, ending, and realizations about this movie made me a completely different person"
191,"""Thank you for asking me. And thank you for not going for one of those melodramatic proposals with lots of people around. I hate other people""I love this movie since the first time I watched it. Since then, This movie be one of my favorite movie. Not like the others romance movie, this movie is different. Not like you met someone, get to know each other, fall in love, and then there's some trouble, break up, and get back…"
192,mimi
193,The romantic comedy genre is not my go to with its cliched lovable loser protagonists and indie soundtracks.  But this one has enough charm and heart that it’s a worthy of its praise.
194,eu amo vcs
195,why are we crying
196,Um dos meus filmes favoritos
197,i liked it sue me :)
198,"Como me hace enojar esta película, es como mi discomfort movie"
199,"can we collectively agree to stop teaching men it's okay to build a relationship on lies (great movie, my trust issues are the problem)"
200,"Go live your ordinarily lives, you ordinary people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
201,"If I could time travel, oh wouldn’t that be nice. Sure, it is a bit predictable and follows many clichés you’d typically expect from a rom-com but I think that’s part of the charm of this film. A well rounded and enjoyable watch."
202,it feels like im reading a book its beautiful
203,Mans is lying manipulating deceiving. I kinda hate it :// like they always do this w male time travelling ppl in movies it’s always him going back in time with cheat codes on the girls interests and job etc.  Its just weird!! Bringing up her love of Kate Moss within the first min of u meeting her would not get u her love!!! I think it’s also just writing shitty women characters. I mean can we rlly expect to root…
204,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Don’t watch this movie if you love your dad 🥲
205,its about time... YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP~ LOLLOLOLOL subscribe for more humorous reviews. haven't seen the movie tho
206,me hundí en mis lágrimas
207,beautiful movie with a beautiful message
208,MUITO bom
209,Great movie. Great cast. Loved this story. Made me feel good about love and family and life in general.
210,started watching it thinking it was just a regular a rom-com and ended up sobbing rethinking about my life choices.
211,Really makes me just wanna cherish every day of life 🥹🥹 such a cute story
212,alright this may be a perfect movie
213,la amo mucho
214,"tw: meltdownive never in my life watched the final 30 mins of a movie in x2 speed till now.first of all, THIS MOVIE IS SUCH BULLSHIT. you mean to tell me that im supposed to envy and wish for a love like that? THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON MANIPULATING AND LYING TO THE POOR WOMAN. i love kate moss headass. like i cant believe he stalked her into a random house party, lied to her best friend,…"
215,"This was at least the fifth time I've watched this movie. I introduced it to my wife in 2020, and it has become her favorite movie. I've finally raised my rating to 10/10. This movie has all the feels -- just don't look too closely at the time travel."
216,"esse sempre me dá vontade de chorar de tão lindo    :(sei que todas as sinopses falam que é sobre ele tentar conquistar a namorada mas acredito que seja bem mais profundo que isso, é muito mais sobre a relação dele com o pai e sobre como aproveitar a vida mesmo que algumas coisas ruins aconteçam, porque sempre vão ter coisas boas também"
217,A feel good movie with a moving story and sort of gives you a new perspective on life
218,well damn
219,Wow. Wasn’t sure I was gonna love this halfway through but certainly delivered in the end. Super thought provoking and worthwhile.
220,it was about time that i watched this movie
221,do they ever talk about kate moss or was the one time enough
222,"No jokes here, this is genuinely just a phenomenal film"
223,Lots to like here in the humor and cuteness but I think the film goes on for too long and is too tonally inconsistent for me to fully love it. I found myself caring less and less as the film went on after being initially hooked by the fun premise and lead performances. I just don’t think I’m a big Richard Curtis fan at the end of the day.
224,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  chorei igual uma vagabunda com a morte do pai dele, acredito que tenha sido um gatilho pra mim. mas toda a história é sensacional, a trilha sonora é sensacional. amei!p.s.: eu também quero um pôster de amélie poulain 😩"
225,"i love this movie so much, one of my favourite movies rachel mcadams has been in. i do admit the ending made me tear up a little, but i managed to hold it in because no one else was on the verge of tears. i think this movie is truly beautiful and it gets you thinking for a while after you watch it."
226,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  My favorite of all time. The ending of this movie always gets me.I just try to live every day as ifI've deliberately come back to this one dayto enjoy it as if it was the full final dayof my extraordinary,ordinary life."
227,não consigo parar de chorar que filme lindo
228,"Assistir esse filme é como receber um abraço quentinho de quem você gosta. Ele é perfeito em todos os aspectos, eu adoro a dinâmica da viagem do tempo, os personagens são fantásticos e a trilha sonora é maravilhosa, um dos meus filmes de romance favorito."
229,Ofc only the men got to do it 😤
230,"This made me sob, it gets a heart. I don’t make the rules."
231,ILLLL MOOOOONDOOOOOO
232,I would go back in time to when friendlies still had blue drink. Better times. This movie also made me cry immensely.
233,beautiful
234,Ok I forgot some of the references to women are a bit dodgy but it remains a firm favourite :-)
235,Beautifully written
236,"il moooondo , de mis películas de amor favoritas me gusta mucho la trama y en si la pareja es Muy linda"
237,Fuck yeah brother oooweee
238,Fantastic film with a true meaning of how to appreciate life!! Wholesome Also Cleo cried
239,chorei muito com ele se despedindo do pai dele 😭
240,Esta película me ha hecho sentir muy cómoda:((
241,hopeless me😸carino
242,For years i refused to watch this movie bc I thought it was a sappy rom-com and in reality it was a MASTERPIECE
243,"achei esse filme muito bom e, por mais engraçado que possa parecer, ele me deu vontade de ter um pai porque a atuação do cara, me lembrando ethan hawke em before sunrise, é tão humana e tão natural - esse filme por inteiro desfruta dessas características de humanidade e naturalidade, na verdade, muito apesar da questão da viagem temporal. até essa mesma parte fantasiosa acaba sendo incorporada nas tensões da vida de tim (a exemplo de como a Vida, simplesmente…"
244,when is it my turn?
245,needed to ugly cry
246,"não achei que fosse chorar com o final, porém me desfiz em lágrimas"
247,i wish someone loved me like all the people in this movie were loved
248,Nossa eu tinha esquecido de como esse filme é bom
249,no início fiquei meio q implorando pra ele acabar logo mas da metade pro final fiquei apaixonada achei a mensagem muito linda chorei muito na cena da praia e quando ele disse o que ele decidiu fzr de diferente do que o pai dele tive um treco lindo demais;RACHEL MCADAAAAAAMSSSSSSS
250,very enjoyable
251,Did bro just reject margot robbie?! 🗿Anyway. LOVED THE FILM. Racheal mcadams looks like a dream in this film ✨
252,"Watched it again, cried again."
253,Great movie i cried i would rewatch it if i could
254,Bro TEARS i am in excruiciating pain WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME started bawling so bad I began to think it was just probably an underlying case of an existential crisis that happens to be triggered by the last ten minutes of the film .......#stoked
255,was absolutely lovely but i cant help but think that time travel would’ve had more serious effects than it does in the film😕
256,I like kate moss too
257,This movie hit a lot of the right notes. It’s as simple as that. A very simple movie with a lot of good flavor that doesn’t trip over itself on the unimportant details and just has fun with its conceptual basis. Cried like a baby at the end. Really catches you off guard when the time comes to feel emotions. Definitely going down as one of my favorites.
258,This is a nice feel good film that could be rewatched hundreds of time. There is a certain british charm that is comes from the characters and their family dynamic. It sticks so true to real life that the superpower feels like a side plot and not something obnoxious that takes over the whole film.
259,obrigado ricardasso por me recomendar MT bom
260,IM CRUSHED😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
261,Simplesmente um dos melhores filmes de romance
262,one time i forgot the name of this movie and just looked up “movie about a ginger kid that can time travel”thought the movie was cute but also weird??
263,"It's absolutely lovely, I only wish it didn't end on ""True Happiness is not Time Travelling at all"" it was a bit too Sainsbury's Advert™️ which made it cheap."
264,Director Richard Curtis asks the groundbreaking question: What if British people were capable of experiencing emotions?
265,I rewatch this for Uncle Desmond
266,sobbed for the entire second half of this movie and was so emotionally distraught that I had to sit in the same room as my dad for quite some time to make sure he wasn’t dying.this was literally the whole package:- silly goofy rom com that made me cry- completely devastating father-death-arc that also made me cry who could want more!!
267,"One of the most inspirational movies I’ve seen…called me out like crapJust…keep watching. Finish it. Trust me.(If it weren't for that ending, it would’ve gotten less stars from me😅)"
268,"Just so incredibly beautiful and fun and heartbreaking and while I actually don't think it's perfect, it just really resonated with me in a way very few films do.Such a creative concept for a romcom and it's executed so well. Curtis's direction is beautiful and I actually thought the script was really charming. Gleeson and McAdams are both fantastic and Nighy is obviously incredible.I do somewhat agree with some reviews that say it has the same issue as…"
269,will always make me cry a bit

284,Started out as a solid romcom and ended as a beautiful commentary on the human life. Loved this movie
285,always get a good cry out of this one
286,bonita bonita
287,"I thought this movie was going to make me cry because of a romance trope, but it made me cry because I fucking miss my dad. Anyways, mission accomplished. Good movie, very sweet."
288,Not many movies can make me cry multiple times throughout. Those 2 hours really pack in so much in just the right way. It has me sentimental for moments I haven’t even experienced yet.
289,🥺
290,Feel something today.
291,"Do you consider yourself a sentimentalist person?Then this brilliant film is made for you!I can't even explain how great this film is.Okay okay, at this point we have love, love and more love.Love explained in two different ways, one of them around the love that you feel for you family specifically for your parents, and in the second place what you feel for your partner.Simply magnificent how it's explained, how the scenes were consequently in…"
292,Necesito un abrazo
293,"Unfortunately, not a fan at first watch. I knew going into this movie I wasn't going to be superrrr fond of it and I wasn't not wrong. The best part was the last 10 minutes when he realizes that the best part of his life was when he wasn't time traveling... yeah life is sweet when ur not cheating ur way through"
294,life is strange but if it had no message or complexity

298,Reflexão sobre como viver a vida. Aproveitando ela como se fosse a última.ROMANCE LINDO!
299,nao eh tao bom mas eu gosto demais lindos tenho memoria afetiva
300,Best film ever made - not close. The overall message and the relationship Tim has with his dad is beautiful.
301,Man. Wish I could go back in time and watch this again.
302,eu to destruída
303,"his dad was very wholesome and the whole relationship was very nice to see, but this movie… there’s no moral to the story, there is no point to it. the main character just takes advantage of every given scenario and is living a life which is led by himself really, nothing is authentic as he tries until it’s his way of the event… i don’t understand how this film tries to display authentic love and chemistry and relationship when it’s just a man being quite beggy? forcing it doesn’t really display true chemistry unfortunately but decent film"
304,Saccharine and problematic if you think about it too much. But at the heart of it an interesting story on the beauty of taking each day as it comes.
305,"Sem boiolagem, um dos filmes mais lindos que já vi"
306,"Writing is rewriting and though there are many passages in my books that are essentially a first take, everything else can take many, many attempts before it finds the ideal shape. And what makes it ideal? I know it when I read it.Paul Lynch"

322,"""No, of course not. No. it’s girl friend. Yeah your friend who is a girl. Which you so clearly are. I’m just gonna go and get my boyfriend, who is a boy…""I live for this interaction"
323,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Still I couldn't accept the fact that he tried to get Mary tricked. Though happy with the message that life has to be lived to the fullest. I love the dad portions. Him as a literature person was absolute best. The girl Mary reminds me of someone very special. Glad, she did."
324,shut up u fucking ginger this is the worst movie i’ve ever seen i hate it so much🖕👎
325,Tears blud
326,"a straight™ banger! it's off to a harrowing start but it does get better past the midpoint. never funny or interesting, conversations feel just as deep as your first couple days talking to someone on tinder, and the heartfelt moments are all about getting those delicious and savory salty tears out of you, not due to its great character development or shocking revelations, just the most basic setups that will surely try move your heartstrings."
327,gostei o começo tava meio devegar aí tava meio ansioso mas o desenrolar dele foi muito bom gostei e o final quase chorei E tem a rachel mcadams 🤌🏻🤌🏻😭😭😭
328,"comfort movie fr""we're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. all we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride."""
329,Bawled my eyes out like a little baby all over again.
330,"i think this movie is quite nice representation of how it is when realistically falling in love with someone. the date scene? i think it perfectly represents the faulty limitations of the mind of two “young” peopleon serious topics , which in the end align with each other , ehich causes them to find each other attractive. BUT it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter at all, as you van see. cause in most cases it’s about individuals, not the whole world. it’s about you. after: oh god it took a whole turn in the end."
331,More of these rom-coms please
332,así se ve el amor
333,This film change my entire life. The best couple ever written by the best way ever.
334,i loved so much. such a sweet movie abt life
335,"solid ginger representation in this one. i counted about 3, maybe even 3.5 redheaded people and all of them were decent, likeable characters. good stuff."
336,"Um filme com uma premissa interessante porém com um contexto muito abordado em diversos meios da cultura pop, a viagem no tempo, o que já te deixa meio pé atrás de ser mais um filme genérico sobre esse tema , contudo esse filme é simplesmente fantástico, mostra um lado das relações humanas muito interessante e debate muito que não dá pra ter tudo que você quer sempre, e você está fadado a fazer uma escolha, como o filósofo Jean-Paul Sartre…"
337,muito bonitinho 🤧 mas eu ainda tentaria ganhar na loteria depois do terceiro filho
338,"Make sure you have enough tissues 🥲. Genuinely moving, amusing, entertaining and a sweet movie."

341,i hugged my parents so hard after watching this
342,First Movie with Sinta:Bias lang ako sa movie na 'to. Third time na 'to tapos with my special someone.
343,Una comfort movie hermosa te amo es bella
344,"daddy issues kicking so hard to the point i could do anything to have that kind of relationship with my dad every moment, seconds, minute, hours of our life should be cherish bc we’re not tim to go back in time and fix what it should be :)"
345,About time is such a wholesome and heartwarming movie. Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson are amazing together. Although it is very heartwarming at times it is so very sad. The scene where Tim goes back in time to the last moment he is able to see his father ever again was so god damn sad I almost cried. A very good romantic comedy that I enjoyed a whole lot.
346,Coração ficou quentinho !!
347,"Película con la que no puedo ser objetivo, es y será mi favorita o si no una de mis favoritas. Su narrativa del amor, en todos sus tipos y sentidos, hace que me enamore de esta obra una y otra vez cuando la vuelvo a ver."
348,… oh what I’d do to go back six weeks.
349,UK Version of Click (2006) ... but way worse.
350,gonna go hug my dad
351,Glad I watched the end of this movie alone cause i was a bit of a mess
352,"""We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride""."
353,"i have always wondered what i would do if i ever could change things in my life. in my opinion, time traveling seems to be the most realistic of superpowers to (theoretically) have. but unfortunately, we were not born superheroes. in this routine and decadent life, the best miracle we have is to learn and be better as go. tell them if you love them, hug them when you love them, show them once you love them. it's a short…"
354,"The Notebook, but ultimately British because Bill Nighy is in it."
355,"La idea de revisitar el pasado adquiere un sentido más profundo en About Time, ya que en lugar de viajar al pasado para escapar de la realidad, puedes revisitar el pasado para aprender a apreciar la belleza de los momentos fugaces y utilizarlos como fuente de aprendizaje y crecimiento personal. Siempre dando la importancia al presente sin dejar de lado el pasado, que es de donde todos venimos.El amor verdadero no radica en la perfección sino en su autenticidad."
356,Depois desse filme eu tive a maior reflexão sobre toda a minha vida.Eu simplesmente amei cada segundo desse filme.
357,nao acredito que chorei com esse filme de BAITOLA
358,No one should see the way I was violently sobbing and dry heaving after this.
359,so very cute
360,The most beautiful thing about this movie to me is all the little moments that happen along the way or in the background. That’s exactly what the point of the movie is to me: to appreciate all the little moments that life gives you. I love everything about this movie and I think I always will.
361,It was awkward boring and odd but in a British way.
362,muito fofo estava esperando so uma romcom e me surpreendi
363,"Já perdi a conta do número de vezes que eu assisti esse filme, e é simplesmente o melhor do gênero ""conforto"" que eu já vi. Acho que justamente por ser uma obra romântica, com uma comédia casual e bastante drama, não porque ele é um show depreciativo, mas por tocar em assuntos delicados que normalmente ninguém aborda. Questionamentos esses que trazem filosofias novas, resgate de aprendizados e alguns momentos da vida que de primeira parecem banais, mas na verdade são…"
364,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Todos nós viajamos juntos pelo tempo todos os dias das nossas vidas. Só podemos fazer o melhor para aproveitar esse passeio surpreendente.Eu amo esse filme.

Amo o relacionamento do Tim e Mary.Amo o relacionamento do Tim e seu pai. As cenas deles se despendindo parte meu coração. Amo as…"
365,i too would go back in time countless times to get rachel mcadams to fall in love with me
366,"This movie has never failed to make me cry in the four times I've watched it. Disguised as a rom-com between Tim and Mary, About Time is actually a movie about a beautiful relationship between a father and his son as they grow up. Well worth the watch despite the holes you can find in the time travel"
367,"Fazia tempo que eu não assistia um filme tão bonito e emocionante como esse, sério é tão lindo que doi, sai desse filme uma pessoa melhor."
368,"I forgot how good this movie is. The time travel premise is intriguing asf and it delivers such a meaningful message. By the end, that shit hits deeeeep and I appreciate the time spent. 8.4/10 🕰️"

377,so he never told her he could time travel?!!also if this was in real life this guy would be a huge creep
378,요것은 왜렇게 따흑스러운것이지!

391,best coming of age/rom-com/oh shit he’s magical/ginger representation movie EVER!!! every time i watch it i levitate into the air
392,"Esse filme e maravilhoso mostra que temos que aproveitar todo os dias como se fosse único, e que qualquer mudança que nos fizemos ou dizemos pode arredar em um efeito muito negativo no nosso futuro e que devemos apenas ""deixar rolar"" maravilhoso adorei."
393,"Made me cry, again"
394,Was forced to watch it at a gun point. Enjoyed it tho
395,"People who critique the films use of time travel, the film really wasn't made for you"
396,I'm not always a fan of these kind of films but this completely surprised me. It was engaging from start to finish. It pretty much jumps straight into the time travel thing which automatically makes it super interesting. It doesn't rely on this ability as much as I thought but instead focuses more on relationships and such. Usually stuff I don't really engage with but ended up loving.There was some great performances that made this extremely memorable. Besides from…
397,vsfd 😭😭😭😭😭
398,"10 years since this masterpiece was released. Based on the title no one would have guessed this is a sci-fi (technically, it is). I watched this on the plane back from Seattle and completely came undone… I haven’t cried like that at a movie in a long time."
399,rachel mcadams try and not be in every rom com challenge fr tho this was so good i could almost ignore his red flags especially at the start and the soundtrack was sick
400,"This was TOOOO enjoyable. (Bro really turned down Margot Robbie I would’ve folded immediately, better man than me fr)"
401,omg just realised i can do half stars on this cool.enjoyed the start but got confused and annoyed at the time travel man throughout itstar because i love rachel mcadams
402,"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details."
403,dps ficou tão sem sentido e chato sei lá
404,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The performances were great, especially Domnhall Gleeson’s family in the film. Makes me wish I had time travel to fix things in my life, but it honestly may not be authentic if that were the case. The time travel gimmick makes for some funny scenarios.Edit:Adding one more thing. I really adored this film, but I couldn’t help but feel the fact that Tim (Domnhall Gleeson) never tells his wife about his time ability makes it feel a little…"
405,"This movie made me feel like I was dying. I hated watching this awkward British ginger keep trying to date Rachel McAdams. People say this is a feel good movie but I felt bad the whole time. An explosive radiation of foul energy.Perhaps I’m just a monster but wouldn’t regular people look like ants if you could keep going back in time like this? Maybe, maybe not I guess."
406,"Sim, eu vi este filme em 2023 e ninguém me obrigou. Tornei-me nesta pessoa… e amei"

409,"definetly one of my favourite romantic movies, specially cause i have feelings for gingerheads. it made me fell in love with life, nd those are the best kind of movies. the thing is we can't travel back in time so if you fall in love don't hide it, we are not here forever."
410,this is the only thing keeping me sane in this weird episode i’m having
411,i would do some wicked shit
412,Definitely need to watch this again when I’m in adulthood and it’s definitely going to hit hard but I mean it was a pretty sweet movie and I liked it.Definitely going to think about this one during my monthly existential crisis late at night
413,jope lloro como una magdalena siempre k la veo
414,"this changed my entire view on life, like actually. his relationship with his dad is so sweet and i admire it so much. when he talks about the last lesson he learned at the end, it just killed me. this is definitely going into my favorites."

421,"Charming, lovely, heartfelt film - everything you'd expect from a Richard Curtis production. Critics may complain about the inconsistencies in the film's rules of time travel, but I found it to be one of the better time travel stories told on film. It sacrifices coherence in rules to evoke an emotional truth about the preciousness of time and how that can impact human life."
422,"“Grande leçon numero 1 : vous pouvez remonter le temps autant que vous voudrez, vous n’obligerez jamais quelqu’un a vous aimer”"

425,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Wow. Well, I guess I saw this long enough ago, that I did not review it back then. I remember seeing it the first time and really feeling like I could see why he would fall for her, but not the reverse. She seemed out of his league if you will. This time around, I was able to let go of all of that and just enjoy the movie for what it is. Richard Curtis (the director) is a genius…"

436,"I wish I could say this was a pleasant surprise, but it's more that all the hype delivered.My all-time celeb crush is Rachel McAdams so it certainly earns bonus points for that. But what stood out to me most was how well they handle the time travel concept. It opens itself up to millions of potential potholes, but thjs isn't that kind of movie. They let it drive the plot without being the main message of the film. In…"

445,WHO WAS THE UNCLE
446,"Saw this film after unknowingly walking into an attempted foursome so the portrayal of monogamous love on film felt so much more comforting than it normally does. Also, Domhnall Gleason and Rachel McAdams have very good awkward meet cute chemistry. Also also, one of the most intimate portrayals of father-son love I’ve ever seen on film. Through out the movie though, I had a very unsettled feeling about how Domhnall’s character was using his time travel power for his romantic pursuits…"
447,10/10The absolute peak of romcoms.

453,a perfect film
454,"Well, this one made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Just a simple lil film about simple ol life. Life is beautiful huh?Fantastic idea. I thought it was executed pretty well. I  feel like it was a little too long for what the film had to say; but I’m very glad I stayed for it."

Não podemos mudar o passado, mas podemos pensar em um futuro!!Gosto como a obra brinca com o elemento de voltar no tempo de mudar certas coisas, mas nisso haverá consequências na vida do protagonista, que podemos observar no forma clara. Reforçando também a ideia de viver nossos dias, mostrando essa moral na relação com o seu pai, Fico feliz em ter visto este filme com meu amor!! Depois de um grande tomando milkshakes, crepes de frango e ouvindo glue song abraçadinhosss! Uma grande memória a ser guardada, lembrarei arduamente!! Amo amo te lorran!!!!"

More than a romantic comedy with a twist, this is an expertly written, shot, directed, and scored masterpiece which bridges the gap between romance, drama, comedy, and tragedy like few have. Ending with a cliche yet profound message that will stick with you for a long time after, this was one of my favorite watches ever."
475,my dad has watched this film so many times that whenever i mention kate moss (icon) he recites the ‘informality of her older shoots’ speech
476,não aguento mais chorar toda vez que vejo esse filme
477,sempre fico feliz quando vejo este eh realmente uma obra de arte como q pode
478,"ok eu realmente achei que seria um filmezinho fofo mas nao tao bom (como one day) mas me surpreendié como um efeito borboleta, mas o roteirista de about time tinha um cerebro (diferente do roteirista de efeito borboleta que tinha uma macaco batendo pratos no lugar do cerebro) muito mais bonito, poético e adorávelo filme consegue criar um vinculo entre quem assiste e os personagens alem de uma cinematografia lindaa mensagem do filme eh belíssima e realmente te faz refletir sobre tempo perdido e escolhas"
479,thank you father for the lovely movie suggestion
480,the message 😭😭😭😭😭 reminder to myself to savor every day!
481,What an absolute load of shite
482,"This is quickly becoming one of my favourite movies, it rips me apart every time. Bill nighy is a legend. No complaints. I would watch this everyday if it didn't make me sob uncontrollably"
483,simplesmente esse filme. li uma review que diz que esse filme é o equivalente a um abraço quentinho e eu não poderia concordar mais. estava precisando. (obrigado rafael pela indicação)
484,"Wait, I want to have a family with my Bf?😭"
485,"o filme ja comeca dando um tapa na cara do diretor de efeito borboleta. as cenas são incriveis, o diálogo é muito bom e tem bastante alívio comico que realmente te faz rir. o filme REALMENTE é bom, mas não entendi porque ele quis ter um 3° filho se isso faria com que ele não visse mais o seu pai??? tem uma ótima história de amor e não apenas um cara fazendo tudo por uma mulher (crítica a efeito borboleta)…"
486,tirei muitas liçoes desse filme
487,I would have loved this movie so much more if I had seen it a few years ago
488,"Lindo e comovente, ao mesmo tempo em que oferece uma visão única e muito eficaz da ficção científica e do romance."
489,How on earth is Bill Nighy this iconic as the dad?How on earth does Rachel McAdams' character think that she looks like a squirrel?And how on earth does this movie go from being a regular rom-com to one of the most heartfelt movies I've seen in a long time?
490,El final en donde muestran lo hermosa que es la cotidianidad mientras estas con esa persona es simplemente maravilloso.
491,I broke some points cause of the perfection
492,ai que filme lindo!!🥺🫶🏼
493,"Um filme fofo bem sessão da tarde, mas juro que se eu tivesse um poder desse eu ficava rica facilmente kkkkk. Linda mensagem de ficar vivendo um dia normal e depois viver de um jeito tirando as tensões da vida e tudo mais, mas sinceramente com essa rotina de faculdade, transporte público e trabalho, de muita gente, eu acho meio brega essa mensagem, era só um número da mega sena e aí sim eu viveria curtindo um dia depois do outro aproveitando as coisas da vida, oxe é cada uma viu"
494,meu filme de romance preferidooo <3
495,Balled my eyes out. I need a day in the life of Harry movie ASAP.
496,Lindo
497,Ce film aurait pu être une excellente comédie romantique sans cette topette d'immonde asperge rousse qui sert de héros principal.
498,i either made the best or worst decision of my life by rewatching about time tonight
499,"vendo de novo e de novo e de novo quantas vezes forem necessárias na minha vida . como se fosse a primeira vez | "" - Only you my girl, only u babe, only u darling """
500,One of the greatest romantic movies with a funky twist that I have ever seen.
