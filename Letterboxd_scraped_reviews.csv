3,"Did I just finish one of the most tearjerker time traveller films of all time at 2 am? Yes.‚ÄúWe are all travelling through time together, everyday of our lives. What we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.‚ÄùThis was a rollercoaster of emotions. It‚Äôs such a lovely film. I loved every moment of it. There were plot holes that would have been better if explained further, but everything about this film will make you‚Ä¶"
4,"El secreto de la felicidad est√° en los detallesUn hombre que puede viajar en el tiempo usa su talento para conquistar al amor de su vidaEmotiva, sencilla, originalUna pel√≠cula tierna, dulce y divertida, excelente para pasar un momento en pareja o en familia, a diferencia de muchos melodramas, tiene una historia muy original, creativa, y con un buen grado de profundidad.Maneja un ambiente cl√°sico pero muy bien adaptado de los melodramas, con constantes toques de humor‚Ä¶"

8,"ive just watched the most amazing film ever (imo). ive never been this broken after watching a film in my life. ive never cried this much after a filmüò≠ (i might never recover). a film about a time traveling protagonist trying to get a girlfriend is such a silly premise, but it sucker punches u out of nowhere. halfway through u leave a lighthearted, goofy romantic comedy and ur transported to a deep, emotional, and moving film that hits u‚Ä¶"
9,not my genre but it's good üò≠

47,esse filme √© muito bom
48,I‚Äôm just here for Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams
49,We‚Äôre just not gonna acknowledge how creepy it is and honestly I‚Äôm not mad about it
50,This is my second time watching it and I remember it being really sweet and heart warming and I did not enjoy it this time. They said prostitute 30x. Not one of the times was funny. I don‚Äôt like rating movies I don‚Äôt like but I made max watch this and he asked me to write a review. BOOOOOOO
51,The main character is genuinely so scary in the first part of this movie‚Ä¶ the wife character is the most like man vision of how a fun lil romantic lead should act‚Ä¶ the time travel makes no fucking sense‚Ä¶ every character is paper thin‚Ä¶ they use the same stupid piano theme after every scene‚Ä¶ the fact that this movie is as highly rated as it is blows my mind.
52,about time for me to get a girlfriend fuk
53,pega diferente verla el √∫ltimo d√≠a de clases de la universidad üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
54,domhnall gleenson is never beating the weasley allegations
55,Only reason why I didn‚Äôt put 5 stars is because I was not warned that I would cry during this
56,"Like Adam Sandler‚Äôs Click, but British and ten times worse"

58,Give me a better soundtrack and it‚Äôs five stars

61,this movie had me sobbing.¬†i should probably call my dad
62,i won‚Äôt cry anymorealways a good reminder of your life and happiness
63,"que roteiro, um roteiro digno de filme com viagem no tempo. esse filme √© um filma√ßo de romance com viagem no tempo, ainda faz voc√™ realmente pensar sobre a vida e sobre aproveitar cada mil√©simo de segundo do seu tempo. sem falar que faz voc√™ pensar toda hora em como voc√™ gostaria de voltar no tempo em v√°rios momentos da sua vida que voc√™ se arrependeu. um elenco incr√≠vel, personagens carism√°ticos e roteiro digno, sem falar da com√©dia que super funcionou. esse filme eh completamente PERFEITO, traz varias li√ß√µes muito preciosas, super recomendo!!"
64,i‚Äôm sobbing i didn‚Äôt think i would sob
65,"Still love this movie, the ending with the day is just ü§åüèºü§ß"
66,Aww :)
67,"One of my favorite movies! It is not just about love but also has the story of family. It is very heartwarming, and I really love the relationship that they have."
68,"Um dos melhores filmes sobre rela√ß√µes humanas e relacionamentos reais. A tem√°tica da viagem no tempo fica em segundo plano e o que se destaca s√£o as intera√ß√µes entre os personagens, principalmente o romance fora do √≥bvio entre os protagonistas, que mesmo diante das dificuldades encontraram beleza e for√ßa em construir uma vida juntos."
69,n√£o ironicamente pensei que ia gostar bem menos(camila j√° pode soltar a faca
70,supeeer super super laku noƒá#minarecs
71,I wish
72,"it‚Äôs crazy because i started this film cringing a little and really not wholly invested at all (time travel? going into cupboards? what?) and yet by the end of it i did cry. i don‚Äôt think i expected it to be as accessible in certain ways as it was, since it‚Äôs basically less about these individuals (cannot relate to tim very much myself) but rather time itself and how it can warp things, so in the end it‚Äôs better to‚Ä¶"
73,best movie of its genre
74,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Can‚Äôt be rejecting Margot like that.
75,I think when it comes to Romcoms - Richard Curtis is my guy.¬†Where do I even fault this beautiful masterpieceI laughed. I cried.¬†This is how it‚Äôs done.I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs ‚Äúsoppy‚Äù or ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù. This is what I signed up for.Unbelievable acting supported by my idea of a perfect script.I think I want to marry Mary

80,What a heartwarming movieü•π I loved everything about this!
81,"i really enjoyed watching this movie. it doesn't require me to think too much but still interesting to watch. sad but totally heartwarming to see. absolutely love the father-son relationship portrayed in this movie, have never really seen a bond like that irl."

87,Me quiero morir.
88,This hurt
89,About Time is just so fucking good isn't it. I watched this recently around April time and I resonated with the film so much that I decided to rewatch it only 2 months later. Well it's safe to say this film is still as good as it was previously.I noticed a lot more in this film the second time round that I didn't notice on first watch. I resonated with the characters much more and it only really sunk‚Ä¶
90,thank you for ruining my life
91,I aspire to be as cool as Tim‚Äôs mom
92,Now I don‚Äôt want time travel powers
93,will never not watch this movie
94,Ug best movie ever made. I wish love was real.
95,"This is what I needed today, do you think that he could live forever? I mean he does have the ability to travel back in time, he only needs to live in dark area, speaking if it‚Äôs a planned death."
96,ahhhh it‚Äôs so cute how can u not love it
97,I forgot how much I love this movieü•π
98,por alg√∫n motivo me encanta estar viva

101,LOVELY MOVIE i cried
102,Wonderful! Rom coms can go terribly wrong but this one is just great! It‚Äôs funny and witty and the cast is really really good!¬†Quiet emotional and just the whole concept too like I‚Äôm quiet a fan of ‚Äútime travel‚Äù movies¬†Domnhall was hilariously funny in this and you get to see Rachel half naked so win win if u ask me Great film

110,About time I watched this again
111,This was supposed to make me feel better like it normally does. It did not
112,why is it giving himym vibes in the best possible way
113,"Great, gets less because of the final monologue."
114,"volver a ver esta pel√≠cula despu√©s de tanto, con la persona que amo al lado, experiencia 10/10. ü©∑"
115,You have to be a sentimental idiot to look past the plot holes and unpleasantness in the romancing section of this but fuck me dead I am a god damn moron and so into this.
116,i would pay to get my memory erased just to watch this movie for the first time again
117,"I mean it was cute, but isn't kinda creepy to obsess over someone like that?"
118,A cena da praia continua a ser das melhores cenas da hist√≥ria do cinema.
119,MARGOT ROBBIE AND RACHEL MCADAMS IN ONE MOVIE ?!?!?!?!?!?!
120,Really love this movie
121,"la vi por primera vez en un autob√∫s de viaje a la playa, desde ah√≠ la he visto como 8 veces, la amo, me hace llorar siempre"
122,"for some reason, i couldn't find a good stream of Can't Buy Me Love, so I depressingly watched this instead."
123,So much more than the simple romcom I was expecting. The amount of love in every second of it was astounding and Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan portrayals have this profound understanding of life. I think Richard Cordery‚Äôs performance as Uncle Desmond at the funeral is what finally broke me.
124,Comfort movie
125,Ang lungkot pala magkaroon ng tatay buti na lang wala ako
126,"La he visto mil veces, mil veces me vuelve a encantar. Vivir el presente, disfrutar los peque√±os placeres, el valor de lo ef√≠mero."
127,"Es que ni se que decir de esta pel√≠cula, pero que lindo el amor y como cada persona lo interpreta o siente de diferentes maneras. ‚ÄúTrue love last a lifetime‚Äù"
128,"‚Äúall time traveling in the world can‚Äôt make someone love you‚Äù muy linda pel√≠cula, no me recordaba lo linda que era"
129,this movie altered the trajectory of my life the first time i watched it
130,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This movie frustrated me because it ended on such a good note. But to me there‚Äôs so many plot holes and the main character is pretty annoying in the fact that he just gets to be a creep and cheat his way through life. Margot Robbie is a plus though
131,ok well shit‚Ä¶¬†Daisy was right.
132,Domhnall Gleeson needs his respect. Such an underrated actor. This movie was so good and so beautiful.
133,um dos filmes mais lindos que j√° vi
134,You would think this movie would be shit but it‚Äôll get you every. Single. Time.
135,que com√©dia rom√¢ntica s√£o essas que me fazem chorar
136,barely passed the bechdel test
137,THE FRINGE IS THE BEST BIT!!!!!
138,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   at times it was beautiful, inspiring, & made me rethink my life and appreciate it more, but i was mostly just annoyed by this movie LOL. barely any of the humor worked for me and i found a lot of the characters just not very likeable ?? even the main two ? im kind of disappointed by this a little. smh. + every decision domnhall gleeson made for the first half of this movie felt like the absolute wrong one. like‚Ä¶"

140,to everyone that advertised this movie as a cute romcom. you are cruel.
141,Llore horas
142,The real crime is choosing between Rachel McAdams and Margot Robbie.
143,this is how I want my life to feel like
144,should rewatchsome parts felt sooo long but it‚Äôs a comfort film
145,ai vou sempre lembrar de voltar pra reassistir esse
146,i honestly don‚Äôt need to write a review but i just want everyone to know this is my favorite movie of all time and if you haven‚Äôt watched it you need to ok byeeeee
147,"i just really didn't like this movie.i'm not a fan of movies where its just entirely the male gaze (random scenes of rachel mccadams stripping, her entire character just existing to be a mother and have sex with him, him using his power of time travel to have sex with her over and over and over, the tent for the wedding party collapsing from rain causing water to conveniently fall all over the womens shirts (who also happen to‚Ä¶"
148,"Im surprised i've never heard about this movie!Great movie very sweet, made me cry but only a little bit and not of sadness but because of a moment that¬†is bittersweet.-----If i had a penny for everytime rachel mcadams played the love interest of a time traveler id have three pennies. Which isnt many but its strange it happened three times"
149,Una pel√≠cula la cual puede mostrar un amor muy sincer√≥
150,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  no way bill weasley pulled margot robbie and rachel mcadams in one movie
151,filme triste e feliz ao mesmo tempo amei
152,c'est ce qu'on appelle un tr√®s beau film ^^
153,im so fucking devastated
154,if you get to the second half this movie becomes more than bearable
155,AMOOOOOO üíï
156,"this is ridiculous. what if i want to travel to the sahara? i mean i‚Äôm not a professional but as far as i know, there aren‚Äôt any closets in the sahara.also i th"
157,Great romantic sci-fi. What Yesterday wanted to be.
158,esse √© um dos poucos filmes que sempre me faz chorar
159,malditasea como me hace llorar
160,hijueputa como llor√© cuando muri√≥ el pap√°
161,"Yeah it‚Äôs lovely, surprisingly poignant and probably Richard curtis‚Äôs best film but it‚Äôs slightly fucked up to think that you could slightly tweak it and it essentially becomes a horror movie about Rachael mcadams ¬†discovering that her life is being controlled by a manipulative time traveller. Still‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.yay romance?"
162,"Well the film left me with a lot of emotion. In retropect some of the twee tone annoyed me a little, and the female characters I thought were a bit male gazey throughout. However despite it ostensibly being a rom com, by far the strongest and most emotional part is the father/son relationship. With Bill Nighy and Brendan Gleeson giving a standout performance."
163,I zoned out halfway through this movie. I really want to get wingstop. Idk why but that‚Äôs all I could think about. I cannot tell you what happened in the second half at all but first half was a solid 3 üòã
164,"Film che non avrei mai scelto di vedere dal poster. Come si dice, non giudicare mai i film dalla copertina... per fortuna un cengone del passato lo aveva messo nella watchlist, non ricordo neanche pi√π perch√©.Insomma alla fine d√† molto pi√π di quello che ci si aspetta.Paradossi temporali a bizzeffe ma anche tantissimo romanticismo sulla vita."
165,This movie is so sweet I just love it so muchü§ß
166,Baba sahneleri beni aƒülatmƒ±≈ütƒ±r
167,Wow quel film je m‚Äôy attendais pas
168,dios la voy a ver mil veces y cada una de ellas voy a llorar
169,por esta pel√≠cula es que quiero un romance
170,"Sommige films breken je echt, lekker gehuild. Toch heel mooi ook en laat me altijd weer even appricieren hoe mooi het leven ook is. Ook met de slechte momenten etc..."
171,No words can express how perfect this film is
172,"The most well-scripted and featuring the most empathetic characters I have ever seen in a film. Bill Nighy as Tim's father was a profound choice; his calm wisdom and sarcastic humor make him feel so human and loving. His relationship with Tim is definitely my favorite of the whole movie, as it is magically nostalgic. Pun intended, as they share similar moments in time multiple times together -- that just makes their connection more relatable. Family movies like these always‚Ä¶"
173,too many gingers
174,Tough choice between Rachel Adams and Margot Robbie ngl.Fun plot and engaging pacing.Romance7/10
175,‚ÄòI‚Äôm so good without the ball‚Äô -Davey Jones to general Hux

179,love is real
180,on wednesday‚Äôs we travel back in time
181,This movie revealed to me that I no longer like romantic movies
182,i love this movie for making me cry so hard üò≠
183,well that was amazing. I will now not be able to get over the walk on the beach. sort of hit every emotion really. beautiful film.
184,"THIS MOVIE IS SWEETTT, OH TO HAVE HIS POWER"
185,Me and who? Might actually be my fav movie ever (the last 15 minutes made me cry)
186,My like 4/5th watch and the end still gets me every time. One of my favs. Also the soundtrack fits so well.
187,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  why do i do this to myselfthis is one of the very few films that can make me sob as hard as i did the first time i watched it.the day bill nighy actually dies is the day i die.
188,still amazing
189,I don‚Äôt know why I keep rewatching this because it just fucking wrecks me every time my god
190,"the soundtrack, ending, and realizations about this movie made me a completely different person"
191,"""Thank you for asking me. And thank you for not going for one of those melodramatic proposals with lots of people around. I hate other people""I love this movie since the first time I watched it. Since then, This movie be one of my favorite movie. Not like the others romance movie, this movie is different. Not like you met someone, get to know each other, fall in love, and then there's some trouble, break up, and get back‚Ä¶"
192,mimi
193,The romantic comedy genre is not my go to with its cliched lovable loser protagonists and indie soundtracks. ¬†But this one has enough charm and heart that it‚Äôs a worthy of its praise.
194,eu amo vcs
195,why are we crying
196,Um dos meus filmes favoritos
197,i liked it sue me :)
198,"Como me hace enojar esta pel√≠cula, es como mi discomfort movie"
199,"can we collectively agree to stop teaching men it's okay to build a relationship on lies (great movie, my trust issues are the problem)"
200,"Go live your ordinarily lives, you ordinary people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
201,"If I could time travel, oh wouldn‚Äôt that be nice. Sure, it is a bit predictable and follows many clich√©s you‚Äôd typically expect from a rom-com but I think that‚Äôs part of the charm of this film. A well rounded and enjoyable watch."
202,it feels like im reading a book its beautiful
203,Mans is lying manipulating deceiving. I kinda hate it :// like they always do this w male time travelling ppl in movies it‚Äôs always him going back in time with cheat codes on the girls interests and job etc. ¬†Its just weird!! Bringing up her love of Kate Moss within the first min of u meeting her would not get u her love!!! I think it‚Äôs also just writing shitty women characters. I mean can we rlly expect to root‚Ä¶
204,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Don‚Äôt watch this movie if you love your dad ü•≤
205,its about time... YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP~ LOLLOLOLOL subscribe for more humorous reviews. haven't seen the movie tho
206,me hund√≠ en mis l√°grimas
207,beautiful movie with a beautiful message
208,MUITO bom
209,Great movie. Great cast. Loved this story. Made me feel good about love and family and life in general.
210,started watching it thinking it was just a regular a rom-com and ended up sobbing rethinking about my life choices.
211,Really makes me just wanna cherish every day of life ü•πü•π such a cute story
212,alright this may be a perfect movie
213,la amo mucho
214,"tw: meltdownive never in my life watched the final 30 mins of a movie in x2 speed till now.first of all, THIS MOVIE IS SUCH BULLSHIT. you mean to tell me that im supposed to envy and wish for a love like that? THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON MANIPULATING AND LYING TO THE POOR WOMAN. i love kate moss headass. like i cant believe he stalked her into a random house party, lied to her best friend,‚Ä¶"
215,"This was at least the fifth time I've watched this movie. I introduced it to my wife in 2020, and it has become her favorite movie. I've finally raised my rating to 10/10. This movie has all the feels -- just don't look too closely at the time travel."
216,"esse sempre me d√° vontade de chorar de t√£o lindo ¬† ¬†:(sei que todas as sinopses falam que √© sobre ele tentar conquistar a namorada mas acredito que seja bem mais profundo que isso, √© muito mais sobre a rela√ß√£o dele com o pai e sobre como aproveitar a vida mesmo que algumas coisas ruins aconte√ßam, porque sempre v√£o ter coisas boas tamb√©m"
217,A feel good movie with a moving story and sort of gives you a new perspective on life
218,well damn
219,Wow. Wasn‚Äôt sure I was gonna love this halfway through but certainly delivered in the end. Super thought provoking and worthwhile.
220,it was about time that i watched this movie
221,do they ever talk about kate moss or was the one time enough
222,"No jokes here, this is genuinely just a phenomenal film"
223,Lots to like here in the humor and cuteness but I think the film goes on for too long and is too tonally inconsistent for me to fully love it. I found myself caring less and less as the film went on after being initially hooked by the fun premise and lead performances. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a big Richard Curtis fan at the end of the day.
224,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  chorei igual uma vagabunda com a morte do pai dele, acredito que tenha sido um gatilho pra mim. mas toda a hist√≥ria √© sensacional, a trilha sonora √© sensacional. amei!p.s.: eu tamb√©m quero um p√¥ster de am√©lie poulain üò©"
225,"i love this movie so much, one of my favourite movies rachel mcadams has been in. i do admit the ending made me tear up a little, but i managed to hold it in because no one else was on the verge of tears. i think this movie is truly beautiful and it gets you thinking for a while after you watch it."

254,Bro TEARS i am in excruiciating pain WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME started bawling so bad I began to think it was just probably an underlying case of an existential crisis that happens to be triggered by the last ten minutes of the film .......#stoked
255,was absolutely lovely but i cant help but think that time travel would‚Äôve had more serious effects than it does in the filmüòï
256,I like kate moss too
257,This movie hit a lot of the right notes. It‚Äôs as simple as that. A very simple movie with a lot of good flavor that doesn‚Äôt trip over itself on the unimportant details and just has fun with its conceptual basis. Cried like a baby at the end. Really catches you off guard when the time comes to feel emotions. Definitely going down as one of my favorites.
258,This is a nice feel good film that could be rewatched hundreds of time. There is a certain british charm that is comes from the characters and their family dynamic. It sticks so true to real life that the superpower feels like a side plot and not something obnoxious that takes over the whole film.

264,Director Richard Curtis asks the groundbreaking question: What if British people were capable of experiencing emotions?
265,I rewatch this for Uncle Desmond
266,sobbed for the entire second half of this movie and was so emotionally distraught that I had to sit in the same room as my dad for quite some time to make sure he wasn‚Äôt dying.this was literally the whole package:- silly goofy rom com that made me cry- completely devastating father-death-arc that also made me cry¬†who could want more!!
267,"One of the most inspirational movies I‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶called me out like crapJust‚Ä¶keep watching. Finish it. Trust me.(If it weren't for that ending, it would‚Äôve gotten less stars from meüòÖ)"
268,"Just so incredibly beautiful and fun and heartbreaking and while I actually don't think it's perfect, it just really resonated with me in a way very few films do.Such a creative concept for a romcom and it's executed so well. Curtis's direction is beautiful and I actually thought the script was really charming.

303,"his dad was very wholesome and the whole relationship was very nice to see, but this movie‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no moral to the story, there is no point to it. the main character just takes advantage of every given scenario and is living a life which is led by himself really, nothing is authentic as he tries until it‚Äôs his way of the event‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt understand how this film tries to display authentic love and chemistry and relationship when it‚Äôs just a man being quite beggy? forcing it doesn‚Äôt really display true chemistry unfortunately but decent film"

BUT it doesn‚Äôt matter, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all, as you van see. cause in most cases it‚Äôs about individuals, not the whole world. it‚Äôs about you.¬†after: oh god it took a whole turn in¬†the end."

345,About time is such a wholesome and heartwarming movie. Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson are amazing together. Although it is very heartwarming at times it is so very sad. The scene where Tim goes back in time to the last moment he is able to see his father ever again was so god damn sad I almost cried. A very good romantic comedy that I enjoyed a whole lot.

359,so very cute
360,The most beautiful thing about this movie to me is all the little moments that happen along the way or in the background.

Acho que justamente por ser uma obra rom√¢ntica, com uma com√©dia casual e bastante drama, n√£o porque ele √© um show depreciativo, mas por tocar em assuntos delicados que normalmente ningu√©m aborda. Questionamentos esses que trazem filosofias novas, resgate de aprendizados e alguns momentos da vida que de primeira parecem banais, mas na verdade s√£o‚Ä¶"

395,"People who critique the films use of time travel, the film really wasn't made for you"
396,I'm not always a fan of these kind of films but this completely surprised me. It was engaging from start to finish. It pretty much jumps straight into the time travel thing which automatically makes it super interesting. It doesn't rely on this ability as much as I thought but instead focuses more on relationships and such.

Makes me wish I had time travel to fix things in my life, but it honestly may not be authentic if that were the case. The time travel gimmick makes for some funny scenarios.Edit:Adding one more thing. I really adored this film, but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the fact that Tim (Domnhall Gleeson) never tells his wife about his time ability makes it feel a little‚Ä¶"

Critics may complain about the inconsistencies in the film's rules of time travel, but I found it to be one of the better time travel stories told on film.

434,"Made me get into a bad relationship. Good job, movie."
435,"posso assistir esse filme vinte vezes, e ele nunca vai perder o encantot√£o lindo, emocionante, fofo e cativante amo esse demias"
436,"I wish I could say this was a pleasant surprise, but it's more that all the hype delivered.My all-time celeb crush is Rachel McAdams so it certainly earns bonus points for that. But what stood out to me most was how well they handle the time travel concept. It opens itself up to millions of potential potholes, but thjs isn't that kind of movie. They let it drive the plot without being the main message of the film. In‚Ä¶"
437,One of the greatest explanations on what i believe is how to be happy and enjoy the moment. Also a cute romantic comedy
438,I hope to be Bill Nighy to my kids.

443,heart warming
444,I want to time travel
445,WHO WAS THE UNCLE
446,"Saw this film after unknowingly walking into an attempted foursome so the portrayal of monogamous love on film felt so much more comforting than it normally does. Also, Domhnall Gleason and Rachel McAdams have very good awkward meet cute chemistry. Also also, one of the most intimate portrayals of father-son love I‚Äôve ever seen on film.¬†Through out the movie though, I had a very unsettled feeling about how Domhnall‚Äôs character was using his time travel¬†power for his romantic pursuits‚Ä¶"
447,10/10The absolute peak of romcoms.
448,"This movie has so many issues but I can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs effective at making me cry. Great stuff, throw logic out of the window and just be sad for a while."
449,"‚ÄúWe're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.‚Äú"

452,"this movie is shocking and I think it‚Äôs the blueprint for good masculinity. i can‚Äôt fault this movie for much, as you think it‚Äôs one thing but it‚Äôs actually a love story in a different way. Good movie"
453,a perfect film
454,"Well, this one made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Just a simple lil film about simple ol life. Life is beautiful huh?Fantastic idea. I thought it was executed pretty well. I ¬†feel like it was a little too long for what the film had to say; but I‚Äôm very glad I stayed for it."
455,A rom com about fathers and sons that made me cry. I‚Äôm gonna call my dad.
456,tengo demasiado que decir sobre esta pel√≠cula pero no s√© como hacerle justicia con palabras as√≠ que me ahorro el comentario

458,"the last half star would've been given if margot robbie was actually gay. i want some solidarity, richard."
459,"A brilliant warm and heartbreaking as Sci-Fi romance filled with lots of warm, witty, and beautiful moments. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was an incredible story filled with beautiful characters."
460,"Creo que estoy muerto en vida, no recordaba que fuese tan cursi. Es una gran historia, pero ya no soy el mismo."
461,a little creepy at the beginning and kinda confusing but overall very wholesome
462,"The most important thing that we can do in life is to treat everyday like it's our last, so let's just keep doing that"

468,"VI EM UM DOMINGO A NOITE COM MEU AMORR!! N√£o podemos mudar o passado, mas podemos pensar em um futuro!!Gosto como a obra brinca com o elemento de voltar no tempo de mudar certas coisas, mas nisso haver√° consequ√™ncias na vida do protagonista, que podemos observar no forma clara. Refor√ßando tamb√©m a ideia de viver nossos dias, mostrando essa moral na rela√ß√£o com o seu pai, Fico feliz em ter visto este filme com meu amor!! Depois de um grande tomando milkshakes, crepes de frango e ouvindo glue song abra√ßadinhosss! Uma grande mem√≥ria a ser guardada, lembrarei arduamente!! Amo amo te lorran!!!!"
469,One of my favorites and I cry almost every time

471,Truly delightful. Loved it very much.
472,"le di m√°s estrellitas x esa quote q dice ‚Äúni todos los viajes en el tiempo har√°n que alguien te ame‚Äùo algo as√≠ dec√≠a, q buena frase la vdd"
473,"poster de amelie poulain, friday I'm in love e um homem ruivo que viaja no tempo. emocionante."
474,"I can recall few experiences with film as personal and moving as my most recent watch of About Time. More than a romantic comedy with a twist, this is an expertly written, shot, directed, and scored masterpiece which bridges the gap between romance, drama, comedy, and tragedy like few have. Ending with a cliche yet profound message that will stick with you for a long time after, this was one of my favorite watches ever."
475,my dad has watched this film so many times that whenever i mention kate moss (icon) he recites the ‚Äòinformality of her older shoots‚Äô speech
476,n√£o aguento mais chorar toda vez que vejo esse filme
477,sempre fico feliz quando vejo este eh realmente uma obra de arte como q pode
478,"ok eu realmente achei que seria um filmezinho fofo mas nao tao bom (como one day) mas me surpreendi√© como um efeito borboleta, mas o roteirista de about time tinha um cerebro (diferente do roteirista de efeito borboleta que tinha uma macaco batendo pratos no lugar do cerebro) muito mais bonito, po√©tico e ador√°velo filme consegue criar um vinculo entre quem assiste e os personagens alem de uma cinematografia lindaa mensagem do filme eh bel√≠ssima e realmente te faz refletir sobre tempo perdido e escolhas"
479,thank you father for the lovely movie suggestion
480,the message üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ reminder to myself to savor every day!
481,What an absolute load of shite
482,"This is quickly becoming one of my favourite movies, it rips me apart every time. Bill nighy is a legend. No complaints. I would watch this everyday if it didn't make me sob uncontrollably"
483,simplesmente esse filme. li uma review que diz que esse filme √© o equivalente a um abra√ßo quentinho e eu n√£o poderia concordar mais. estava precisando. (obrigado rafael pela indica√ß√£o)
484,"Wait, I want to have a family with my Bf?üò≠"
485,"o filme ja comeca dando um tapa na cara do diretor de efeito borboleta. as cenas s√£o incriveis, o di√°logo √© muito bom e tem bastante al√≠vio comico que realmente te faz rir. o filme REALMENTE √© bom, mas n√£o entendi porque ele quis ter um 3¬∞ filho se isso faria com que ele n√£o visse mais o seu pai??? tem uma √≥tima hist√≥ria de amor e n√£o apenas um cara fazendo tudo por uma mulher (cr√≠tica a efeito borboleta)‚Ä¶"
486,tirei muitas li√ßoes desse filme
487,I would have loved this movie so much more if I had seen it a few years ago
488,"Lindo e comovente, ao mesmo tempo em que oferece uma vis√£o √∫nica e muito eficaz da fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica e do romance."
489,How on earth is Bill Nighy this iconic as the dad?How on earth does Rachel McAdams' character think that she looks like a squirrel?And how on earth does this movie go from being a regular rom-com to one of the most heartfelt movies I've seen in a long time?
490,El final en donde muestran lo hermosa que es la cotidianidad mientras estas con esa persona es simplemente maravilloso.
491,I broke some points cause of the perfection
492,ai que filme lindo!!ü•∫ü´∂üèº
493,"Um filme fofo bem sess√£o da tarde, mas juro que se eu tivesse um poder desse eu ficava rica facilmente kkkkk. Linda mensagem de ficar vivendo um dia normal e depois viver de um jeito tirando as tens√µes da vida e tudo mais, mas sinceramente com essa rotina de faculdade, transporte p√∫blico e trabalho, de muita gente, eu acho meio brega essa mensagem, era s√≥ um n√∫mero da mega sena e a√≠ sim eu viveria curtindo um dia depois do outro aproveitando as coisas da vida, oxe √© cada uma viu"
494,meu filme de romance preferidooo <3
495,Balled my eyes out. I need a day in the life of Harry movie ASAP.
496,Lindo
497,Ce film aurait pu √™tre une excellente com√©die romantique sans cette topette d'immonde asperge rousse qui sert de h√©ros principal.
498,i either made the best or worst decision of my life by rewatching about time tonight
499,"vendo de novo e de novo e de novo quantas vezes forem necess√°rias na minha vida . como se fosse a primeira vez | "" - Only you my girl, only u babe, only u darling """
