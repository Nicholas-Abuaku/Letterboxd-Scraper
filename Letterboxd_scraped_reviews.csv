1,“my holes can take me anywhere”
2,"one of the most overwhelming viewing experiences of my life, compounded by my inability (refusal) to pee for about 100 minutes. outstanding. another banger for the canon of guys who love to loudly recognize something (e.g. “that’s spider-man, from spider-man”)edit: whoops almost forgot to add a very important note: if u look like rio morales, dm me……."
3,This is gonna be so lit when I can watch it at 0.75x speed with subtitles
4,"What an incredible treat this movie is. It’s been several hours and I’m still beaming with joy. The colors, the animation, the humor, the soundtrack; everything about it was damn near perfect and I enjoyed myself to the fullest from beginning to end. The only bad thing about it is that it ended."
5,"After the movie no one had any idea what to say, we all just stood around flabbergasted and overstimulated. Absolutely embarrasses almost every CGI movie that tried to bite Spider-Verse’s style over the last five years (Mitchells Vs the Machines innocent). Some of the minor action scenes in this would be the centerpiece of other movies. Just incredible to look at with a genuinely surprising plot.Loses one star from me because I found a lot of the ham-fisted references…"
6,I rewatched with my friend and instantly started crying with the first frame and didn’t stop for 40 fucking minutes I’m not kidding. Also I was high. this shit is magical
7,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Prepare to be Dune-d
8,No words can do this justice
9,look out here comes the spider-sweep
10,"If the second half of this movie is as good as this half, it’s going to be a 5-star 5-hour movie"
11,SO FUCKING GOOD. Better than the original. Easily my favorite movie based on a Marvel comic. My brain is fried. I have no idea how they did any of that. The score is so good. I’m going to listen to it on a loop once it’s released. Don’t let anyone spoil anything! Animation forever! I’ve literally considered quitting making live action stuff after seeing this.
12,"a mind-blowing combination of magical artistry, post-modern imagination, and dunking on Jeff Koons. I’m in awe."
13,MOTHER FLIPPING DING DONG THAT WAS INCREDIBLE
14,"i'm not joking when i say you need to see this asap, giant screen, full sound system, large slurpee and popcorn, as many people as you can to come with you. mandatory. viewing."
15,Holy shit?? Lmao
16,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Man, I can’t believe there’s an elite crew with all the best spider people in it!!"
17,The most ambitious animated film of all time.I will never forget seeing this in theater. Bursting with beauty AND heart.Full review coming soon…
18,Pump this shit in my veins
19,"WOW. This manages to strike an UNBELIEVABLE balance.Countless nods and references to everything Spider-Man that somehow don't overwhelm the film.Multiple characters get brilliantly paid off arcs, all while maintaining massive anticipation for Beyond.I can’t believe this exists, and that there’s MORE TO COME!"
20,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Previous one was jokes, here’s my thoughts. Are there a few lines in speeches that are very simple in the last 30 mins? - Sure. Are the number of Easter Eggs overwhelming and impossible to even try to understand? - Yeah.Is this a two-hour plus half of one movie? - Totally.Is the Villain in the second half of this movie?- Not reallyDoes any of that matter?- Nope! Why?- Because this is a fucking fantastic,…"
21,There was a scene in this which gave me full body goosebumps. Legitimately can not remember the last time I got that from a movie.
22,Sony I solemnly swear to watch all of the Morbius and Venom sequels if you keep making these
23,waiting for Sony to announce that Gwen’s world is canonically the Rhapsody in Blue segment of Fantasia 2000
24,put this masterpiece in the louvre right now
25,"Staggering. Unquestionably one of the greatest animated films we’ll witness in the 21st century. (Until maybe Beyond the Spider-Verse)There’s been so much sequel syndrome in the last decade, especially in the sphere of superhero movies, but Across the Spider-Verse succeeds not because it throws in hundreds of Easter eggs to appease its audience— but because it continues to care more about the story, the characters, and the world(s) they occupy. The love is in the details. Every frame and every pixel.…"
26,"There are some movies out there that can't possibly be disliked, and the moment someone says they didn't like it you know theres gotta be something wrong with them. This is one of those movies."
27,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Kind of conflicted about this one. I really loved Into The Spiderverse and it’s pretty much a perfect movie from beginning to end in my eyes. The fact that this is a part 1 holds it back in my opinion. I definitely enjoyed it and it has cool moments but I wasn’t really satisfied by the end. Which sounds strange because I technically shouldn’t be because it’s a part 1, but in comparison I was satisfied after I watched Dune part 1. Idk maybe I need a rewatch but I kind of feel like I just watched +2 hours worth of setup for part 2."
28,"wow!! a spider-man movie that utilizes a multiverse AND tells a genuinely heartfelt story in a visually stunning way!! (yes, this is “No Way Home” slander)"
29,"Honestly I feel like this is overstuffed, busy with so many stories but doesn't really ever settle down to actually tell any of them. That said it's very funny and completely visually dazzling front-to-back so ultimately that's not a huge concern."
30,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  guys i think there's an elite crew with all the best spider-people in itidk, just a hunch"
31,we need a spider-man for short white guys on the spectrum
32,"73Front-to-back psychedelia. If you thought the first movie was a trip for the senses, this sequel will shape-shift your whole world. Absolutely mindboggling shit. Just like Into the Spider-Verse, I'm less enthused with the multiverse narrative at play. It's cool, but I'm content to put a lot of the cameos and cute references on the backburner and just stare at the pretty colors, the sheer variety of textures, the wit of the rapid-fire humor, and the dexterity of each…"
33,ADIDAS (All Day I Dream About Spider-Punk)
34,Coughing baby (mcu spider-man films) vs hydrogen bomb (spider-verse films)
35,"What psychopath decided to end it there, I want to have a word with them"
36,"Finally some cinemaGenuinely great on every level, but it's absolutely refreshing to see Spider-Man used in a worthwhile way for the first time since Infinity War"
37,"pretty good! i don't know how sold i am on the central narrative conceit here, that being the framing of spider-man ""canon"" as a metaphor for miles' struggle to live life by his own standards. it's maybe too-meta-by-half in a way that doesn't really excite me (though teenage esther would have had her mind blown by it) but it's hard not to appreciate a superhero movie keeping its multi-universe shenanigans so firmly grounded. the first movie's story was faultlessly executed…"
38,Haven’t been this happy after a superhero movie since the credits started rolling in Quantumania
39,there can be 100 spider-people in a spider-society and 99 of them don’t believe in you but just one does
40,i hand her the phone to write her own review:“i loves it and it is my favorite character is the sprider girl and she was wearing the shoes people at my school wear. it was my first movie at the drive in tihs year”
41,oh yes. OH YES!!
42,one of the best marvel movies of all time and I’m so serious
43,i’m kind of over multiverses at this point but i’ll allow it if they do it this spectacularly
44,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a sensational, jaw dropping, heartfelt, thought provoking masterpiece of animated cinema!If you thought Into the Spider-Verse was good, Phil Lord said “Hold my beer!”  From the get go, the astonishing animation grabs you and and pulls you into Spidey’s world once again, where it bombards your brain with a kaleidoscope of colors and web-swinging fancy.  Every frame oozes charm and style to the point where it’s almost sensory overload.  It’s smartly written and packed to…"
45,"""It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of [Spider-Man]."" - Mark FisherBrings me no joy to praise a Spider-Man cartoon movie in the year 2023, but this is entertaining and clever. I was sharpening my knife ready to take this movie to task for how its many universes are all basically the same with superficial variations, but then the movie went ahead and made that point.I was moved seeing Miles' poor treatment from the council of Spider-Men as it uncannily parallels my own recent rejection by the Toronto Film Critics Association."
46,"“That’s a metaphor for capitalism bruv.”Astounding. So much better, more thematically rich, and surprising than I possibly expected. It’s got about a hundred bottles of lightning and it’s just part one. I’m gonna need to see this 20 more times."
47,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  great! can't wait for part 2!
48,Wow
49,"www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OJCbiBFmLc First Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 brought in the very first F-bomb in the MCU and now this movie from the clip (link above) brought in a legit swear word in an animated family movie just in Spanish so that viewers won't recognize that Miguel sweared. What Miguel said was ay coño which means ""oh cunt"" and cunt is one of the worst swear words next to the n-word."
50,"To get a couple of quick complaints out of the way- it’s a little too long- has a lot of the same problems that the second movie of a planned trilogy has- A couple of spoiler things I would rather not post since I got to see this early.That being said, the humor works and the animation is so fantastic that all of the above issues are very easy to ignore.  Definitely worth seeing on a big screen."
51,"It’s extremely rare that a sequel will manage to meet the levels of its monumental predecessor, but Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse manages to accomplish just that. Beaming with inspiring visuals, a substantial amount of ambition, and heart. The artistry is second to none, a visual feast that doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to providing jaw-dropping sequences. Multi-verse story telling at its finest, and even when it does lose a sense of direction, it manages to pull itself back in and regain focus. Dare I say it, Marvel’s best project to date (alongside the first)."
52,shout out to whoever made the decision to give the oscar isaac spiderman an absolutely ginormous ass
53,"There are generally two types of sequels: The ones that rehash the previous film’s success for financial gain, and the ones that use the previous film’s success as a license to experiment. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse isn’t just that second kind of sequel, it’s actually about making precisely that sort of movie. Its real villain isn’t the Vulture or the Spot, it’s storytelling orthodoxy; the idea that you must create a work of art in a certain way simply because that’s how it’s always been done.Full review at ScreenCrush."
54,"I’m a Raimi defender 4 life, but this is the closest any of the spidey movies have come to topping the OG trilogy. Remarkable.One of the best animated movies of all time."
55,letterboxd didn't add a 6 star rating option solely for this film????????? unbelievable
56,The penultimate consequence of the industrial revolution just made me shit my pants
57,"Brimming with creativity and life in each and every shot. Not a moment is wasted visually. The story feels a bit too comic booky in a way that holds it back from reaching genuine pathos for me. If you bring multiverses and evil for the sake of evil villains into things I start to check out emotionally. Despite the massive cliffhanger it didn’t leave me eager for what was going to happen next, I moreso just felt like the story at hand just needed another 20-30 minutes to properly wrap up."
58,Perfect. Truly Masterpiece. One of the best animated films I've ever seen.
59,WE ARE SO BACKKK
60,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  One little bit of foreshadowing I did not notice the first time: When Miles goes to evil Earth-42, and puts on that dimension’s Miles’ jacket, it’s dark green with a purple hood — a clue that this Earth’s Miles is the Prowler. (On Miles’ own Earth, his hoodie is black with a red hood — I.e. Spider-Man colors.)"
61,"Well, here we are again. For the second time in my life, an animated, non-mainstream Spider-Man movie—from a franchise that follows mostly webslingers NOT named Peter Parker, tracks its sequels not in numbers but in prepositions, and is visually reminiscent of old school dubstep music videos—has made me feel like the “LOOK WHAT JESUS DID” guy from Ted.Outside of the ridiculous voice cast, the trippy score, the dope soundtrack, and the otherworldly animation (getting different forms of artwork to so…"
62,[leaning over to my date for the 600th time] that's spiderman
63,"Dare I say.. This was better than the first Spider-Verse film. SO much fun from beginning to end, the bar is set so high it ain’t even in the atmosphere anymore."
64,"Zur Videokritik: youtu.be/87OFMS3Q9ZAUnd sie machen es wieder. Ich war fest davon überzeugt, dass „Into the Spiderverse“ ein einmaliger Kunstgriff war, dessen Fortsetzung unweigerlich schwächer sein muss, aber gut - komplett geirrt. „Across the Spiderverse“ ist abermals fantastisch, auch wenn der Film hier und da über seine eigene Erzählung stolpert.Der Kern ist aber erhalten geblieben: „Across“ behält wie der Vorgänger stets die Beziehungen der Figuren im Blick, die mir längst ans Herz gewachsen sind, um die ich bange wie…"
65,"The artistry in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is so breathtaking that it nearly brings you to tears. But even beyond the awe-inspiring animation, the story’s beautiful blend of sincerity and epic spectacle redefines what superhero storytelling can - and should - be. A triumph (and maybe the definitive Spider-Man movie?)."
66,"The subject of this series is genuinely vital and contemporary: it’s about occupying, renovating and subdividing intellectual property. Sony and Marvel’s biter corporate compromise has yielded two enjoyably self-aware films that simultaneously satirize and celebrate the ready abundance of Spider-Man related content; this one pivots on the possibility that messing with the canon is not only possible but liberating. Deep pocketed technical mastery yoked to exuberant, expressive conceptual impulses - plus more good visual, verbal, and contextual jokes than strictly…"
67,"When a film is so good you feel lucky to be alive when it came out.I rarely talk during movies but we only 10 minutes in before I turn to Pann: “I think we are about to experience something real special”. Credits roll and I’m wiped out, I don’t even want to check my phone to see if there was an extra scene, let me catch my breath, I haven’t recovered from the rollercoaster yet. We walk out and…"
68,Oh my Flippin’ doodles
69,"Wow! Even for a Part One, SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE exceeded all of my expectations. More emotional & thrilling than the first with a vibing soundtrack & dazzling animation. The creative forces behind this sequel really outdid themselves here with the storytelling, sound (the score adds so much to overall tone) & visuals. In a pool of talented voice performances Oscar Isaac was the MVP for me. A highly ambitious but satisfying set up for what’s to come."
70,"it's pretty astounding that after years of the same beloved Spider-Man imagery repeated again and again, from upside-down kisses to the t-pose ""holding something together with webs"" shot, this movie finally manages to invent new iconography that feels equally quintessential. the sequence with Miles and Gwen hanging and looking at the city upside down? that's instant Spider-Man required reading. unforgettable.another thing I love: the sheer expression through the eyes of a Spider-Man mask in these movies is something you…"
71,"Holy fuck. I’ve never seen anything so kinetic in my life, I’ll have to watch it 10 times to catch half the details. It’s a cornucopia of Spider-lore and over-the-top visuals but even though there’s a bombastic transition every millisecond it somehow manages to be dripping with emotion. It left me with the same thought I had after seeing Fury Road for the first time: how is it possible that this exists?"
72,part two now please
73,"This movie is an unbelievable visual feast, so much so that it is virtually impossible to take it all in with a single viewing. There are sequences — particularly the ones involving Gwen and her father — that are among the most stunning pieces of animation I’ve ever seen. There are individual moments of real emotional power, and the vocal performances are uniformly excellent.And yet, this movie simply does not work as a single, standalone narrative — a full…"
74,"Stunned. Exceeded expectations in every way imaginable and some I never would have imagined. I would go out on a limb and say that this will be my sons favorite movie, forever, except I know there’s another Spider-Verse movie coming eventually....and I have zero reason to doubt this creative team anymore. Definitely not the last time I’ll be seeing this in the theater. 2023 RankedTake The Pledge to CinemaDegrees of Kevin Bacon: 11. Shea Whigham and Kevin Bacon in Cop Car"
75,"Miles Morales feels lost,So he must get Across.He and Spider-Gwen,Meet all Spider-Men,Ready to face the big boss."
76,"Word is out that this is the best spider-man film ever made and surpasses the first. So let's just be clear, ITSV has 4.4, I think that's enough said to understand how hard it will be to surpass the first. Likely impossible. But I hope it does. I want something revolutionaryEdit: it was revolutionary"
77,i need a solo spiderpunk movie i'm so serious
78,"Some have said that this feels like half of a movie, and I understand where they're coming from, but especially on the rewatch I totally disagree. the plot is not resolved, but there is a full arc for everyone here in really satisfying ways - even if it's an arc toward failure. I guarantee when this trilogy is complete, like Empire, this will be the one we come back and appreciate most. it's a meditation on Spider-Man as a character…"
79,"Haven’t checked the box office but something tells me this sequel to the “groundbreaking” original Miles Morales lead spiderman film is going to score very high. My whole theater was pretty much crowded and while it wasn’t as packed as in “Super Mario Bros Movies”, there were some big lines when I left. About hundreds more than those that were back when I first watched the first one.And it couldn’t happen to a better film, which I would have…"

81,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Hard to really put into words how much I loved this. Maximalist storytelling at its finest. Every shot was spectacular, every new character was everything, the new score was great. Kinda mind blown at this point. There’s so much vibrancy, so much character, so much insanity. There’s also heavy use of a coming out metaphor that I was kinda incredibly gagged by and I loved it. It makes this whole series feel like a natural epic. Incredible voice acting. I…"
82,"Didn’t know the first 10 minutes of a movie could make me cry more than UP but here we are. This is literally the most beautiful animated film I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Audacious, technically dazzling, and unending in its inventiveness. The type of movie that pushes the medium forward. Incredible.Watch my review on The Filmcast"
83,i just came out of the theatre as a changed woman. this movie is going to be my entire personality now
84,"Into it! Across it! What a joy for something this cool to go down so well. Good things happen (even if we have to wait years for the kinda cliffhangers usually handed on a plate in a week's time – love these, and many other, big swings)"

87,"It's very rare when a film comes around that makes you reconsider everything you've previously seen in that particular medium. However, Across the Spider-Verse does exactly that and more. Following up a fantastic film can lead to some lofty expectations that might seem unattainable, but this wonderful sequel manages to surpass the original in so many ways.The animation is astonishing. Genuinely jaw-dropping. Every single frame is bursting with color, mixing different animation styles, and oozing passion and creativity. The…"

89,"Yet another month, another Marvel movie masterpiece. With a combination of bombastic animation and electric music selection. Across the spider-verse, manages to exceed on every level. But it truly excels with a heartfelt story that makes you think about your own story and values!"

91,Yeah no the first movie is dogshit now. This was peak.
92,"Across the Spider-Verse is the movie that animation needed to show the beauty of this medium.A visually stunning journey packed with references to other versions of Spider-Man through the years.If you were surprised by the good use of the multiverse in the previous movie, you're not prepared to see what they've done here."
93,Yeah sure it's really beautiful and stuff BUT ALSO it's very funny. I don't see enough reviews talking about how funny so much of it was.
94,"Holy shit you guys, I think they did it again."
95,i just rewatched this entire movie on a tiktok livestream where the top half was across the spiderverse and the bottom half was fortnite gameplay. has society gone too far? has it not gone far enough? is this what god intended for us? was the industrial revolution a mistake?
96,A movie so good it kinda pissed me off when it ended. I would've been down for another third act instead of having to wait another year.

101,"My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. I am the one and only Spider-Man.holy shitttttt. THIS is how you do a superhero movie perfectly. the animation was absolutely beautiful and so so artistic, the characters are really fleshed out and developed, the story was great and the action sequences were so fun! 10/10 cannot WAIT for beyond the spider-verse! 🕷️"
102,"Not only did this film exceed my towering expectations, but it also rendered my review of the original trivial, as this absurdly spectacular follow-up somehow manages to surpass nearly everything its sensational predecessor perfected. It began vigorously and only got more engrossing, immersing you in a multitude of dimensions that were each incorporated with a distinct and riveting visual style. The film impeccably executed its incredible twists and comical amount of references, included an astounding cast of extraordinary characters, each…"
103,"Oh great, now this film just got banned in the Middle East Countries just because there was a Trans flag sign at Gwen’s house. really? Did you have to go that far? These countries don’t even know what “LGBTQ” is. Looks like Lightyear and other banned films are not alone on this.But I think Wes Anderson should make a Marvel movie since we have Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray all in a Marvel project this year.I Blame Geeks and Gamers, Ryan Kinel, and Trollsworldtour fan2001 for this."
104,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I just watched an early screening and WOW. This movie is the greatest animated and comic novice movie of all time and is probably the best movie over the past couple years. And that cliff hanger left me shocked😵
105,"an unbelievable kaleidoscope of color and sound and unstoppable character, it’s rare to get a project of this ambition made and it’s even rarer to see it through to its total and utter fullest potential. how anybody could watch this and still be fine settling for the MCU or whatever is totally beyond me"

112,overwhelmingly incredible visual and audio experience with consistently well-rounded characters who make realistic and relatable choices only thing is… not sure they’ve done a sufficient job of letting people know this is part one of a two-parter. know beforehand that there’s more coming in less than a year!!!
113,"second time watching, i really see where the movie loses itself and where the flow breaks, but the third and fourth act made up for what i did not like. my first time walking out of the theater, i was at a loss for words. part two will definitely be worthwhile. believe me, part two will be the best of the three."

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is made by pure genius people who are genuinely loves comic-books. Wilder, crazier, the hype is insane. Every transition and style is perfection. It feels like reading Spider-Man comic-books on a big screen but instead of that I am watching all of the issues with a neat, fantastic, and surprising plot.

118,"I went into this vibrating with excitement. I loved the first one so much, and the trailers for ACROSS were so vague (focusing mostly on one chase), that I was certain they were only hinting at all the imagination that the rest of the 140 minutes contained. For the bulk of the running time, I was all in, a giant grin on my face loving every wild move the filmmakers made, as it pushed the animated style to its utmost…"

128,NO WAY HOME FOUND DEAD IN A DITCH
129,"It’s really refreshing to see a film that’s mostly sequel set-up actually use that to its advantage; rather than jumping from one action set piece to another, it takes its time with quieter moments of true emotional stakes, abandoning most traditional blockbuster pacing for something more careful, deliberate, and just as daring as the animation itself. This is also one of very few film series we currently have that I do not doubt is absolutely going to stick the landing. PS has nowhere near enough Spider-Cat for my liking"
130,rick and morty but good
131,Algo que entiende esta franquicia al igual que las de Raimi es que la esencia de Spider-Man no es ser un superhéroes que pelea contra villanos. La esencia de Spider-Man reside en su identidad y la gente a su alrededor. Por eso resaltan entre todo lo demás que se ha hecho del personaje.
132,Spread those wings. It's time to tell your story. We never knew what to expect. Not when this started. But that all changes overnight after you have a first film blow minds and a sequel that could really change lives.Where do you start with this? It is hard to find the right words. There was a lot riding on this. Just from how long the wait has been and coming off the first entry that has already made a…
133,THIS IS THE GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE FUCKING MISERABLE LIFE
134,There must come a point when seeing the same film three times in three days is too much…but that could never be Across the Spider-Verse. This film is a masterpiece and I can’t wait to go back and see it time and time again on the big screen! It is literally a work of art and deserves all the acclaim it can get! Easily the best film of the year!
135,"can't wait for the next one where there's another solid 60 mins of compelling comic book family drama supplemented by 80 more mins of Rick and Morty shit and just when we think Miles and the gang are cornered Tom Holland is like ""guys, you're gonna wanna see this"" and it pans over a bunch of IPs we've never seen before but when it zooms out it looks like a spider symbol and there's a story going around about how many animators died getting Spider-Whopper's nose hairs just right"
136,"I loved this film. It is truly phenomenal. I have always been a Spiderman fan ever since I was a kid, and these spiderverse films are just amazing for the fans. They both have a beautiful story, and this film is an amazing sequel. This was my most anticipated film of the year, and it exceeded my expectations. The first spiderverse film was one of my favourite films of all time. It was my comfort movie and now this film…"
137,fuuucicjcjkkjkkjkk me that was incredible
138,"See what happens when people are given full creative control and see it through to the end? Isn’t this what superhero movies are supposed to look and feel like? Shouldn’t they be bursting with colors and filled to the brim with genuine creativity and passion? If so, how did we ever let the MCU conveyor belt convince us otherwise, that being overly stylized is bad, with most of their movies looking like dishwater?"
139,Was Zurück in die Zukunft II für Zurück in die Zukunft I war:Mehr von allem. Ein bisschen zu viel. Ein bisschen zu gleich. Trotzdem erfrischend anders. Verspricht ein spannendes Finale.Die perfekte Fortsetzung.Genau dasselbe bedeutet Across the Spider-Verse für Into the Spider-Verse.
140,"""Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go. Nah. I'm-a do my own thing.""Where the first Spider-Verse was about coming of age and discovering your identity, Across is more about coming out and owning that identity — not necessarily out of the closet, but if the blue, pink, and white color palette motifs of Gwen's universe are any indicator, then that's a big part of the subtext here as well.Miles hasn't told his parents that…"
141,DONALD GLOVER AAAAH
142,"it’s a banger—a funny, beautifully animated and thoughtful piece of work."
143,OUT: pretending to be santa claus or the easter bunny or the tooth fairy IN: going to the cinema with a spiderman morph suit on underneath your normal clothes and a funky watch that you’ve timed to go off at specific points during the movie but being subtle enough about it that any six year old in proximity is going to have the time of their life figuring out whether they’re sat next to a superhero
144,"This will be an unpopular opinion, but here we go... The very definition of all style, no substance. I spent 2 hours and 20 minutes listening to a ""story"" that gets explained in about 10 minutes during the middle of the film, with filler all around it... For starters, the pacing is atrocious. Dragging through several sections, while speedrunning through any semblance of a cohesive narrative. It seems like they just wanted to cram as much fan service and quipy…"
145,I brought a water bottle full of beer to the theatre and i opened it during a silent part of the movie and it made the loudest TSSSSS noise ever and stunk up the whole room. so i just stashed it and didn't drink any of it. either way i didn't need it the movie was really good excited for what's to come next on their awesome adventure
146,The stuff with Gwen Stacy at the beginning of the film led me to believe that I was about to watch the greatest animated film of all time. Gwen's world is objectively incredible with its watercolour-like hues that drip and morph in reaction to Gwen and her emotions. Her very emotions and turmoil felt literally adapted to the scenery behind them; with how the world fades when Gwen is conversing with her father. It's some of the greatest bit of…
147,This film just single-handedly cured my depression
148,TO BE CONTINUED?!?! BITCH WHAT IF I DIE BEFORE THEN
149,Peak.
150,"I’m glad this was able to match and at times surpass the first one’s formal stamina and punchy writing, and I think general audiences were due a good cocktease. As overstimulating as it is, there’s surprising room to breathe which I appreciated, but I think this major strength is related to the film’s ultimate weakness. It’s the same thing people criticized about EEAAO and Multiverse of Madness, that the maximalist veneer of a multiverse actually covers up the shallow and…"
151,"I liked, but did not love “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Visually resplendent and abundantly hilarious, yet extremely overstuffed with one subplot that landed very uncomfortably with odes of copaganda."
152,Best picture nominees are gonna look like a fortnite lobby
153,"So much of the demand to treat comics and comic-book films as Art has been entirely focused on matters of narrative and theme, pushing material into ever more serious realms while still deferring to the medium's child-targeted roots. But the truth is that comics were taken seriously decades before Frank Miller and Alan Moore; it just so happened to be the actual art and not the prose. Jack Kirby's wild, psychedelic, pop-Bleakean vision was extensively feted in the 1960s; ditto…"
154,Cinematic equivalent of porn without a cumshot
155,"Takes the joke everyone makes about how each filmic iteration of Spider-Man follows the same, tired beats and multiplies it to the nth degree, fully embracing the core tenets of the character that Kevin Feige would insist his newest, freshest interpretation rejects, actually. You can, and should, do whatever you want with a ultimately fun and funny hero-as-canvas (and villain, really) when you can create a world that looks like *this*."
156,Holy manoly that was good.
157,Well I feel this movie was way over hyped or I’m just the odd man out. I didn’t hate this film but I don’t think it was anything special. Constant loud background music ruining some moments in the film for me. And I also didn’t like how this ended I was just finally getting into the movie and boom they end it! So that’s my take aways from the film I’ll probably have more that I’ll add in the comments section once I can really think about what I just watched.
158,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the definition of a MASTERPIECE. The story is emotional, characters (and all the countless Easter eggs) utterly brilliant and honestly it’s the best animation I’ve ever seen, it’s jaw-droopingly gorgeous throughout. Miles is once again a brilliant character and the addition of Spider-Gwen (who is again a stand out), Spider-Punk, Spider-India, Peter B Parker and the many MANY more ‘Spider people’ we meet, is exhilarating…but it’s the addition of Spider-Man 2099 that I adore most…"
159,Among my favorite films ever. It is a work of art with each frame deserving of being hung in the Louvre.
160,"Miles, being Spider-Man is a sacrifice. That's the job. So we're just supposed to let people die? You have a choice between saving one person and saving every world. To me, that's an obvious choice. I can do both! Spiderman always.... Not always. What about Uncle Ben? If not for Uncle Ben, most of us wouldn't be here! First time watch.

163,"Escuchen… me gusta mucho esta película. De veras. Pero creo que no es pecado decir que prefiero y por mucho a la original!Creo que esta secuela hace todo más grande y una escala mucho más explosiva en todos los sentidos pero creo que el guion está un poco cargado y si son como 3 películas en 1, cosa que siempre ocurren en algún punto con las películas de Spiderman. Pero es que está cargada de cosas más buenas que…"
164,The hype is real. Quite a step up from the first movie which was already pretty great. This one raised the stakes. So much action. So much colour. The pace did not slow down at all. The visuals were jaw-dropping. It was funny but also had plenty emotional depth. Amazing work with another Spider-Man outing.
165,"One of the biggest achievements in cinematic history. What Across the Spider-Verse is able to accomplish is absolutely unreal. With over 1,000 people on the crew (largest of any animated film in history), clocking in at 140 minutes (longest of any American animated film in history), every single frame is a piece of art. I am still in awe of this movie… somehow they manage to even improve the artwork from this first film with BEAUTIFUL colors, multiple worlds that…"
166,"Qué bello trabajo sigue teniendo al desarrollar con problemas tan humanos al buen Miles Morales, amo la relación que tiene con sus padres, hasta me identifiqué con él con su horrible sentimiento sobre nunca pertenecer y lo inadaptado que la vida te llega a hacer sentir.Mejora en relacionar a los personajes principales y la evolución que han tenido, sobre todo con la soledad de SpiderGwen y las motivaciones de Miguel O’ Hara.Además sigue siendo bien divertida y ya…"
167,"loved this. A whole movie about being excited to make images, pull inspiration from every part of the world around you, every image you see. what it means to be excited to tell your story, to canonize your trauma, to destroy your life with fantasy, to draw the people you love, to watch them die. funny, then, that this is so lived in it’s buzzing. Between the cop shit, the bizarrely coy trans allegory, the broadness of the Mumbai section,…"
168,"Obsessed with the watercolor art style in Gwen’s world. The way the colors change and bleed into each other to match the mood of the characters as they talk is sublime. I just wanna stare at this movie forever, absolute visual feast."

170,"My 100th Review on Letterboxd so sorry in advance about the lengthSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales a year and a half after the events of the last film, as he reunites with Gwen Stacy and is shot across the multiverse to the epicenter of a Spider-Men society that is charged with protecting the multiverse’s very existence. However, when they come across a threat to the entire multiverse, Miles finds himself pitted against everyone as he tries to…"

Within 5 minutes I was brought to tears by how overwhelmingly stunning and busy the visuals were, and throughout the rest viewing I began to cry many more times.I knew that Across the Spider-Verse was going to be one of my favorite movies of the year, but this is potentially one of my favorites…"
173,GAGGG ORDERRRRR
174,"Across the Spider-Verse, could have easily made a completely new story from the first film and it probably would've been great but instead the plot manages to seamlessly thread the first & second film together that genuinely has me wondering if they wrote the whole trilogy at once.This just fucking rules y'all, animation is once again pushed past our imaginations, I can't believe the worlds and characters achieved in this, it's maximalism at its best.Some people may hate the…"
175,"Remember how good Into the Spider-Verse was? This is miles better. I feel so lightheaded leaving the cinema. The whole thing is so sensorially sumptuous and tactile, visually and auditorily inventive, that the entire time watching, you might feel as if the colors are percolating through the screen, bleeding out into the real world and slowly drenching you in it, making you a part of its world. No wonder they took almost 5 years to make this, and it shows…"
176,"The phrase ""This is X's Empire Strikes Back"" gets thrown around a lot when talking about a popular film's sequel. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse does what every great sequel does so well that people will soon stop saying ""It's X's Empire Strikes Back"" and start saying ""This is X's Across The Spider-Verse.""The writing, acting, animation and beautiful mixture of colors and explosions come together to create a wonderful continuation of what made the original so good, surpassing it in…"
177,I don’t even know where to begin. I expected this to be amazing but it somehow even exceeded those expectations. Easily one of the best sequels ever and probably the best animated movie in a long time. The animation here was spellbound. Words won’t do justice for the stellar animation work done by the crew here. Every shot looked spectacular and the whole vibe of this movie was euphoric. I was constantly smiling at the screen with overwhelming joy. The…
178,"I would love to go against the grain and say Across the Spider-Verse is an overly hyped symbol of mediocrity. However, I was completely hypnotised by the incredible amount of detail in each painstakingly designed frame. The varying worlds are visually distinct, and this isn’t a case of beautiful but stilted imagery; this is a wildly kinetic and propulsive cinematic experience. It is certainly a more unwieldy beast than its predecessor, a common feature for a sequel, and its lack of finality may prove grating to some. Still, this feels like a significant landmark in animation and in the wider superhero genre as a whole."
179,"The way this movie humanizes the concept of “canon” is incredible, articulating a truth I’ve only just begun to clue in on. Those patterns you fall into and believe you’ll never break out of? That’s canon. Other people’s opinions of who you are and what you do? That’s canon. Obsessing over past misfortunes, scrolling through an ex’s profile, simply seeing acquaintances from decades ago splattered across the web? Canon, canon, canon. And it doesn’t help us one bit. Miles is…"

I mean this hit all the right notes, especially emotionally. Moved me to tears more than once. Also, the soundtrack for this was absolute fire, nothing but bangers. Voice cast was once again spectacular too. The animation was out of this world. I won’t pretend to know the details or…"
182,"Wow... just WOW! one of the best animated films ever made. a film that was well worth my money and time. the final act was just incredible, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I want to go back and watch this again and again fr. beyond the spider-verse is in 10 months and I can't wait to see what happens next! this was a wild ride."
183,"Way easier to process the second time lol.Every frame of this thing is perfection. I don’t have a single critique, I have nothing of analysis to add, just awe. It’s a different kind of feeling to sit in a movie theater and watch history happen before your very eyes. We won’t get something this world shattering for a long long time.Or at least until the next one comes out.Third time’s the charm.“Nah. I’mma do my own thing.”"
184,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   2023One of the most frustrating experiences I’ve had in quite a while. The animation is even more inventive than the first, some truly audacious experimentation with the craft going on here. But I felt so much of the character, heart and interpersonal relationships are all undercut by laying the groundwork for a third film. It’s frustrating because the film itself is largely incredible, just like the first. But the minute the gears begin to shift from the movie you’re…"

Never have I ever been so impressed, so emotional, and so blown away by such a rich and powerful display of animation like never before, Across the Spider-Verse has exceeded beyond my expectations like never before!

192,HOW THE FUCK DID THEY MAKE THIS ONE BETTER THAN THE FIRST. HOW. HOWWWWWW.
193,literally didn’t want to look away for even a second of this movie because every frame was so beautiful. this really is the most spider-man movie ever and not just because there’s so many spider-men but they really dug into what makes a spider-man story a spider-man story and where do we go from here. I can’t wait to watch this again and I can’t wait for the 3rd movie. fuck. I love spider-man!!!!

Maybe the most frustrating viewing experience I've ever had. It's so good. The animation, the score, the voice cast, the action - everything is a level up from the first one.

It’s awesome.Every character is awesome, Gwen is a highlight this time around too. She gets so much to…"
201,"I’ve always been an unashamed Marvel nerd. These characters, first the movies and now the comics that inspired them, have brought so much joy into my life over the years that it is hard not to have a bias against anything that depicts them. That being said, when the first film, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, came out, I had no idea what it was. Without seeing a trailer, or any advertising for it, I went to the cinema with a…"
202,"More than proves Into the Spider-Verse was not a mere case of lightning in a bottle. The trilogy that is unfolding before us is on par with the trilogy behemoths of the past. The next generations’ Lord of the Rings. Fantasy pushed to the extremes of scale and scope. A refinement of craft that we can’t get anywhere else right now, not at this quality. Mesmerizing and fantastical and moving. Where Into the Spider-Verse brought the multiverse to us, Across the…"
203,"If you asked me to rank all the films that could tentatively be called ""Spider-Man 2"" in their own series, this would very well be the second best one.Don't quite think this one holds a candle to the original Spider-Verse film but it certainly captures the essence of how even though so many films have since tried to imitate it (even Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, while I like it a lot, I find does fall into this…"
204,"“You call this art?”“We’re talking about it, aren’t we?” Could pause this on any given frame and spend at least 5 minutes talking about the symbolism, the position of characters on screen, how it’s animated, the coloring, the lighting. Can’t get so many specific moments out of my head. Top five contender is as Gwen lets out a guttural cry of, “Dad!”, the space behind her begins to bleed with the inkiest blacks. Unreal, gripping, an absolute feast to take in."

It's incredibly entertaining from start to finish. I've never been more glued to my screen since ever, i even barely touched my phone while watching it. The visuals & the color palette is literally the best one I've seen from an animated movie. The animation is gorgeous, i might even have a…"
208,"Between this and the first film it seems the team behind these films has figured out how to make the perfect Spider-Man films. There is just such a strong understanding of the character shown in the first film and maybe showcased even stronger here. Again the animation and different styles are a visual treat that are unique yet familiar, allowing for so much personality and character to be infused to every scene. The performances are great, the story fantastic, and…"
209,Undoubtedly the best movie of 2023!This is my first time watching cinema on IMAX and I'm glad that Igot the perfect film to experience it!The animation was really good and every frame looks so immersive. Totally it was an unforgettable experience for me.
210,"Just don't understand why anyone would want a live action superhero film after seeing something as beautifully rendered, emotionally cogent, and wall-to-wall exhilarating as this movie. Breathtakingly gorgeous, love that the filmmakers' big takeaway from the last Spider-Verse was to lean even further into abstracted, color-splash backgrounds that underscore how the characters are feeling. Every frame a painting and whatnot. Think they could have easily wrapped up at least one of the main stories in order to give this movie its own arc, but even if it's only half a movie, it's half of a really, really excellent movie."

All neon colors, juxtapositions, transitions and jokes interacting in what is, ultimately, an audiovisual style of storytelling rather than just depending fully on a narrative or expressionistic/impressionistic form, Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse raises the bar on the possibility of the multiverse concept, properly applying effective humor throughout…"

221,"Holy shit.Larger and more ambitious than the first one in almost every way. Bigger stakes and even more Spider-Men, but never at the expense of the very personal and emotional story. The character development is incredible, with Gwen's story being the easy standout for me. The movie's fairly long and it doesn't waste a single minute. It could've been five hours long and I wouldn't have complained.The animation is mind-blowing. As gorgeous as you'd expect from a sequel to Into The Spider-Verse. I don't know how they did it, but they did it. Again. What an incredible movie."

225,"An admirable effort for what it is essentially a half formed product, the bones of its characters and emotional arcs very clear but ultimately somewhat directionless within the confines of the film. The story swings haphazardly from conflict to conflict, its focus changing on a whim as it recalls other threads that need to be pulled upon. The best middle child films tell a complete story while serving their transitional roles in the background, so when your sequel is nearly…"

Liebevoll, wahnsinnig kreativ, vielschichtig, witzig und erwachsen wurde uns die Welt von Miles Morales gezeigt sowie das Multiversum, aus dem er Besuch bekommen wird. Der Oscar damals völlig verdient für den Streifen.…"

Hugely important supporting role and he's incredible.  - One minor thing that drove me nuts in the first movie was giving Gwen ballet shoes/wraps.

233,this is like the best ending to a movie ever and i’m not even kidding
234,It really somehow got better on rewatch. Time to blast this Metro album for the next week.
235,"Easily the most immaculate piece of animated work that has ever been developed accompanied by a banging score and boomin soundtrack (pun absolutely intended). Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is bigger, bolder, and grander than the first and I am SO happy to see so many people fall so deeply in love with it immediately and rate it so highly!I’m not here to rain on anyone’s parade. I really enjoyed it! The story to me felt lacking compared to the…"
236,"Didn’t think they could top the prowler theme from the first movie, holy crap. Anyway imagine releasing another animated movie this year after this, I almost feel bad for the studios that will try."
237,I thought I wasn’t going to enjoy it as much on a 2nd watchI’m clearly an idiot
238,"Had to give this a second watch in theaters, it's just so jammed packed full of personality, style, and beautiful visuals. One of my biggest takeaways this time around though is how much I love the added focus on Gwen in this. I mentioned in my initial review that she might just be my favorite character in this soon to be trilogy so far, and yeah, I can confirm that is most definitely the case now (🏳️‍⚧️ 💜). Having her…"

240,After seeing the first movie again it’s wild that this is what follows it
241,"Despite me and my sister had one of the worst movie experiences in quite some time, this was still a blast to watch on a second viewing! Again, the animation is nothing like we’ve seen before and it’s visually incredible to look at. I still love where they took with the story and characters, as well establishing new rules that sets up the world nicely. Miles and Gwen’s arcs are great too. Spot is already a bigger and greater multiversal…"
242,"Every time Miguel O'Hara pops up on screen, I audibly moaned."
243,"""MUSTACHE""...No matter how amazing you expect Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse to be, it's better than that. DEVACHAN, but like, without the DEATH part. 🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤5 outta 5 donned ol' glovers At the Movies (2023)Best of 2023 (4.5+ only)"
244,"Genuinely moved to tears here a good soundtrack really does heighten a movie by at least tenfold and this is already an incredible, incredible, hydrogen bomb of a movie even when muted. I needed it to go on forever it's like crack fuck me, elem klimov could never."
245,Maybe if Miles wasn’t such a milkman this wouldn’t have happened (I am so grateful for this movie it’s so great).
246,"Loved it. The sequel to Into the Spider-Verse is visually busy and overwhelming and at the point where there's so much going on that you know you're missing a lot in every frame as your brain tries to catch up, but it's gloriously dense and ambitious and imaginative and wild. And while it's only half a movie (with part two coming in 2024), the themes that at least start to be presented here are knotty and interesting ones that'll give Spider-Man fans and superhero fans a lot to talk about."
247,"This is just a placeholder for what I hope will be a better experience with the movie down the line. Spent two hours admiring and occasionally in awe of what I was looking at, but found much of the rest talky, exposition-heavy, and just less fun than the original. I guess I'm in the minority that I found the canon-event stuff more interesting in theory than in practice. Thematically clever; narratively inert. Felt like we finally got a real movie only in the last few minutes, but that of course was only setting up the sequel.I'll take the L on this one."
248,"And we now continue with a rewatch, and yeah this was still as breathtaking as the last time. I'm still unsure wether it's better than the first one though, I think Into the Spiderverse still has the edge for me. But I'm still in shock how they managed to pull this off twice now, it's nothing less than a miracle. If you had told me 5 years ago today that these movies would change the entire landscape of the entire…"

253,"Oh my god, my life was changed again by a couple of spider-people!"
254,"It’s great, but for me it’s not quite as good as it’s predecessor. The animation on display is astounding. In a way it reminded me of Speed Racer, there’s so many colors and styles being thrown at you. It’s overwhelming in the best way possible. This may be an unpopular take, but I think this was about 20 minutes too long. The film drags at points. I found Into the Spider-Verse to be much more consistent from start to finish. Also, I’m…"
255,"Honestly, I could just sit here and write a continuous narrative on this film and how it hit it out of the park, or I could simply give it the ""Holy Shit"" in full phraseology encapsulation that it is worth. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fully imaginative in every source of the word. Some small things first, systematically from the ground up it is a well written film full on in design. Multiverse narrative can be a topical casserole that…"
256,"That was so fantastic and absorbing that I literally forgot it was the first half of a two-parted and was stunned and excited when we got to The To Be Continued moment. Even more visually stunning and audacious than the first film, great work on turning Gwen into a co-lead, and just full of thrilling action, sharp comedy, and poignant character work. These films continue to set a high bar that their live action peers can’t come close to clearing. Also: Shea freaking Whigham. Always wonderful."
257,Now this was really something
258,"One of those films that you instantly throw in your top 5 of all time ❤️ FULL NO SPOILER REVIEW CLICK HERE#SpiderManAcrossTheSpiderVerse  is not just the BEST Spider-Man film of all time, it’s not just the BEST COMIC BOOK FILM of all time, it’s not just the greatest sequel ever made, it’s bar none one of the best films I’ve ever watched. More than a masterpiece. This is everythingthe feeling this film gave me brought back the feeling…"
259,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  A masterpiece. Perfectly captures the complexity of being forced to conform to a society that won’t accept you unless you fit a certain “narrative”. It has so much to it and so many layers, and that’s not even to mention visually all that’s going on. It’s really fucking beautiful and genius and holy shit what a fucking movie.Also Hobie Brown is the fucking goat"
260,"Fine, I'll say it: I should probably be giving this an extra half star.There's a lot of talk about how groundbreaking the animation is, and that it's a game-changer for superhero movies... both rightfully so. But risking hyperbole here, sitting in the theater, I felt as if we were all watching a sort of cinematic demarcation. Like there will be pre-Across the Spider-Verse movies and post-Across the Spider-Verse movies. Not just animated or superhero ones. That isn't intended as…"
261,"they’ve fucking done it. they made another movie whereas the sequel succeeds even more than the first. It’s pure madness especially with the sprinkle of the animation and storytelling, it just cranks it up another notch and I love it so much. me and my co workers were hollering and in tears."
262,"Tonight’s session was one of the loudest, most enthusiastic (but still respectful) audiences I have ever experienced in a theatre - and I went to the No Way Home premiere"
263,One week away now and I’m literary shaking ever 2 hours in the day waiting for this flick. Consider this 5 stars for the clip of Miles and Gwen swinging and talking with more chemistry & more charisma than the entire YA romance genre.
264,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   “It’s more of a meta commentary on what we call art but it’s— also art?”My feelings on this are annoyingly complex—I feel like the pacing is crazy at times but I also don’t know how I would better change it and I’m also a hundred percent sure I’ll love it after Beyond comes out. The connective tissue between some of the scenes here is stringy (get it?) at best here but I have faith it’s just the half movie…
265,"Okay... Let me start with this. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Spider-Verse film. It's not that I hated it. It just didn't quite click with me as an 18-year-old who wasn't so enthused with films then. It's still rated 4 currently, and I have yet to watch it again since then. Now, the second Spider-Verse. Oh boy, it took me a while to come up with words.It's amazing. Simply amazing. I was hooked from start to…"
266,“You want in?”Can’t think of a better spot to spend my birthday than back in the theater with my favorite movie of the year.
267,"this movie is a testament to what you can do with animation when it's done right. take even when you take away the characters and the story, the animation alone is worth the price of admission and then you threw in a great story, with real characters that you care for, with real conflict, and you get one of the best superhero movies ever made. and i really hope they stick the landing well with beyond the spiderverse (else i'll kill myself) because it would definitively be the greatest spidey trilogy of all time."
268,"The multiverse movie subtly postulates that there is some other, better universe where everything worked out. This movie suggests that the ""right timeline"" is up to us; our universe (by which I mean the small, personal worlds we all inhabit) is only as good as our actions make it. That it manages to make this idea thematically coherent while still being half a movie is pretty impressive. Good movie!"
269,The only thing I have to say about this film is that I want the third film to come out right now! Also I want Peter B Parker to be my dad.

271,"let's do things a little different, eh? for all the praise the animation gets, there's surprisingly little investigation into what it's in service of. animation doesn't exist in a vacuum and the dazzling spectacle it can wrap you in doesn't have value-neutral meaning. the emotional currents the waves of brightly coloured, swift and fluid animation ride on aren't all they're cracked up to be under scrunity. here are a few reasons why.for a film about a multiverse, it contains…"
272,Easily the greatest film about doing everything you can to avoid school ever.

278,I feel like this is definitely less precise than the first which is probably bc it’s a two parter but my god I was on the edge of my seat
279,"The craft on display here is undeniably awe-inspiring but this is a whole bunch of hectic nothingness stripped of the wit and soul of the first film. More a bloated advertisement for the next one without any pay-off or rich emotional stakes and plenty of cameos and terminally online in-jokes than it is a fresh, invigorating spin on the already tired multiverse gimmick. Desperately wanted to love this but it ultimately just feels like painstakingly designed but exhausting eye candy."
280,IMMA DO MY OWN THINGWho could have predicted that it would still be Sony and Columbia making the best Spider-Man anything in the MCU era? What a world. I’ve seen this in two separate theater chains and both have the worst dialog mix I’ve ever heard. Anytime someone speaks when music is playing I dunno what they are saying. My first viewing I thought the speakers were busted but maybe just every version shipped to theaters was bad..??Anyway more on the next 70mm episode.

282,"“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” explodes onto screens this week, building on the foundation of the masterful “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with stunning animation, unforgettable characters, and complex themes. The first note I took after seeing it was “so much movie.” Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame, “Across the Spider-Verse” is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas. It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me…"
283,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Best Spider-man Movie Part-2??A Big Yes.A worthy sequel and worth waiting for 5 freaking years. Very very much entertaining.

284,My new favourite movie about holes(You don't need to know what the other ones are👍)
285,Unparalleled spectacle. A kaleidoscopic marvel and a testament to the cinematic marriage of sound and vision that pushes the medium of animation even further than its predecessor. I’ve long been obsessed with the concept of sequels and here I am presented with the most ingenious deconstruction/reconstruction/subversion/inversion/invention.I had lost entirely all hope that the mainstream* entries of this genre could even possibly contain surprise let alone astonish with delight after the all too similar disappointment of unimaginatively realised Spider-man: No…
286,"probably the most reactionary spider-man story i’ve ever seen, even counting this week’s amazing #26. i disobeyed every impulse guiding me away from watching this, against my better judgement, and was thoroughly disappointed. i didn’t think it was possible for anything under the sun to cheapen my opinion of the first spider-verse but this more than did it. only the depth of my respect for the audio/visual craft (which i won’t waste any more space elaborating on) that went into…"

291,The most visually stunning movie I’ve ever seen
292,Absolutely incredible. There's only one flaw: it ends.
293,"Illustrates itself like a beautiful poem that has the best written verses you'll ever witness. The animation isn't beautiful just to look beautiful, it's beautiful because it works beautifully"
294,"first 45 minutes or so, when they're doing normal Spider-Man stuff, is terrific. if anything even more stylish and kinetic than its predecessor, and likewise honed in on the heart of the character(s). but as i feared, it loses a step once the multiverse stuff gets going and never really recovers - still orders of magnitude more exciting and gorgeous than most any superhero movie coming out these days, but bogged down in sci-fi exposition and increasingly messy emotional stakes.…"

297,Colorful; compelling; creative; different; humorous; incomplete; overlong; twisty.
298,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Not nearly as good as the first one but its hollowness is successfully camouflaged by showy maximalist animation, an overly chaotic third act and a slew of shallow ""recognise THIS???"" bullshit. To me the real genius of Into the Spider-Verse wasn't in Miles but the older, jaded Peter B who like the audience has seen this play out before, but through mentoring Miles the wonder of Spider-Man is reignited for both him and us. It playfully makes fun of the…"
299,It’s the Godfather Part II/Empire Strikes Back of animated movies.

301,"I feel like there are colors in here that I've never seen before. That somehow, the filmmakers found a whole new spectrum to play with in order to fully do justice of their vision of this multiverse. Perhaps they, too, blew up a super collider to gain access to a whole new realm of color and movement, to give us a film that makes every single frame a unique visual treat.Fundamentally, we are still telling a story about what…"

304,"OH MY GOD THIS MOVIE WAS FUCKING AMAZING!!! I cannot even find the words to express how much this blew my mind. It’s a real masterpiece from start to end. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the animation, the crossovers, the characters, the way in which all of the universes had a different style, every little detail is just a work of art. Seeing all the spider-mans together was a lifetime experience for sure, i had the urge to scream everytime a…"
305,My expectations were already so high but this still blew me away. This was an emotional roller coaster. I was honestly at a loss for words. The kind of film that sticks with you right after you left the cinema all the way to your ride home.
306,"Score : 10/10 ✅Spiderman always wins and today, it won big time. Spectacular animation techniques, breathtaking visuals, phenomenal writing, and a fearless way of making Miles Morales confrontational with his peers while offering a celestial cliffhanger. A cinematic triumph across the movie-verse. Magnificent on every level.Films like Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, Terminator 2, and Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers make the case that sequels have the possibility to be better and…"
307,"The Matrix Reloaded of comic book movies, a film that builds upon the practically flawless foundation of its original work to make something far less airtight but takes that structure into a pure, unfiltered assault of experimentation and expression to create something wholly new out of a tired genre. I wouldn’t fully put it past anyone feeling mildly unsatisfied at this essentially being half a story, it ends right at a such a high of escalating momentum right before ripping…"
308,"KARL, CLOSE YOUR MOUTH!I had to remind myself to do so throughout the further adventures of Miles Morales aka Spider-Man. His second outing in the suit is a staggering work of art that uses all facets of filmmaking to deliver a pure cinematic experience. It propels what an animated film can do into the stratosphere. Am I being hyperbolic? I think not. It’s truly a work of artistic genius. It’s not only a visual feast but has a better…"

310,"Had no reason to flex so hard in every concievable way.I had some doubts beforehand, but this film had me absolutely transfixed from start to finish. I'll probably talk more about it on my YouTube channel soon since there's so much more I have to say about it, but for now all I'll say is that it's a mesmerising masterpiece that blew my expectations away. And I think I might just love this one even more than the first."

317,"Welcome to a new review, from me.When I saw Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse for the first time, I was thrilled. It is still for me, one of the best Spider-Man movies ever, if not the best. I was of course looking forward to the sequel: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. A film that completely thrilled me, but which, in my opinion, surpassed the first part in some respects, and at the same time, disappointed me in others. I'll start with…"
318,"Well, are we sure that wasn’t the most emotionally overwhelming movie to ever release? I can’t imagine a movie that makes me more tense."
319,Can we take a moment to realize that one of the canon events is definitely the guy played by Post Malone saying “Yeah I think it’s a banksy”
320,"Esta es la mejor película de Spiderman? Sí. Sí. Definitivamente sí. Pasamos de una de las peores películas del superhéroe a la mejor versión que puede ofrecer. Esta es una película con alma donde se nota que cada artista puso lo mejor de sí. Me preocupaba que las referencias fueran más importantes que la historia pero no es el caso. Sin duda tiene el mejor guión de una película de Spiderman. Solo quiero hacer énfasis en la animación. La BENDITA, DIOSMIOSANTA NO MMES ANIMACIÓN.

I did not know how they achieved this level of artistry, this level of animation and comic-book adaptation. Later, I watched it over and over again to…"
322,YES![Hopefully will rewatch it on Digital so I can hear better on some of the dialogue]
323,MY FIRST PREMIERE WAS THIS!!!This has to be the best film of the year 100%. Watching this with a bunch of marvel/spiderman fans was the best part and the suprises along the way was unbelievable. This was 100% better than the first film and I loved every part. The animation is the best we’ve ever seen with every scene more beautiful than the last. This is 100% a must watch and definitely one of the best experiences I’ve had at the cinema👏👏
324,It’s yet again. One of the best Spider-Man movies.

332,"As much as I love Into the Spider-Verse, I think this sequel takes what works about the original and cranks it up to eleven! Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film, but I’m pretty sure you knew that already. First off, the animation! Do I need to say anything about it at this point? It’s SO GOOD! It’s beautiful, vibrant, detailed, and creative to its fullest. I love the many unique styles they went with here, and it all blends…"
333,not even being slightly hyperbolic when i say that is one of the best films i’ve seen in my entire life.
334,"YAZIDA SPOILER YOK!Ne yalan söyleyim; filmden ilk çıktığım zaman kafamda verdiğim puan 4,5/5 idi. Filmi izleyeli birkaç saat oldu ve düşündüm düşündüm; ilk filme 5 verip bu filme 4,5 vermemin açıklaması ne olacak? Filmin yarım bitmesi mi? Her anlamda ilk filmin üzerine koymuşlarken sırf yarım bitti diye puan mı kırmalıyım? Mâkul bir sebep gibi gözükse de hakkını teslim etmek fıtratımdır dedim ve 5i bastım yine. Görsellik gerçekten bambaşka bir boyuta ulaşmış. Bu kadar karmaşık ve görsel stil açısından yorucu…"
335,"20 pages of notes later…”Yeah, I’m thinking one of the best movies of all time.”This thing is a fucking PORTAL in IMAX. You just fall into it and are swept up in the pure artistic expression of it all. Completely STUNNED to live in a time where something this miraculous exists. This is the kind of cinematic experience you can’t wait to share with your kids. I’m so thrilled for the generation that gets to grow up with THIS being the gold standard of spider-man and comic book movies. Like Jesus Christ what a picture."
336,"Very cute. Great entertainment value. Stunning animation, I loved how it kept changing. That 2 hour 20 minute runtime killed me, damn, that 3rd act could’ve used some tightening up. Fun movie overall though."
337,"It’s an old cliche at this point to say these things are “about trauma” or what have you, but I was pleasantly surprised at the almost (almost) auto-critical way this went about it - we as an audience know the beats a Spider-Man story ought to hit, and perhaps it’s our expectations that lead to creative stagnation in “capeshit” storytelling. This is, proudly (too proudly), “a new kind of Spider-Man story” in ways textual, metatextual and formal, and while it certainly…"
338,a masterpiece. 11/10. i have no words. worst part was that it ended
339,"Occasionally a film comes along that reveals that the borders we place on certain genres or mediums (I.e. comic book movie / animation) are not true limitations but arbitrary boundaries born either from a lack of thought/creativity, a disrespect for the genre/medium, an excess of ""safe"" choices from risk-averse studios, or option D: all of the above."

Across the Spiderverse manages to improve on every aspect of its predecessor with some of the most breathtakingly gorgeous animation ever put to screen. Into the Spiderverse has led to this renaissance…"

This film simply amazes and is made for the big screen, it is the most beautiful film I have ever seen in terms of animation style and it convinces you from the intro to the end credits. You just can't take…"
346,"Now i get why everyone gave it 5 stars.Across the Spider-Verse keeps the essence of the first movie, but goes beyond, it is much more ambitious and mature. Even though it is more complex than the first movie, the story is perfectly written and executed, everything here works fine. The characters are well developed too and most of them have an important role in the movie. Also, we can't say anything new about the animation and score, outstanding as…"
347,"59/100Much closer to the nonstop stylistic freak-out that I'd wanted from Into, though there's still a lengthy and to me rather tedious stretch set on [dutifully looks it up] Earth-1610, which mostly conforms to standard computer-animated design. (Rest of the review, along with everything else I write, available via ultra-cheap subscription. Seriously, it’s as little as $1 a month and for now that pays my rent.)"

But yes it’s a rare Sony win for fantastic story telling not counting the first one because that’s obviously brilliant too. What a genuinely brilliant twist…
350,"""Take a crap on the establishment. I salute you.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an emotionally charged, gorgeously animated, full fledged kaleidoscopic assault on the senses. It completely conveys what the magic ofreading comic books feels like and brings a fresh challenge to the fundamental underlying premise of Spider-Man that pain is an integral ingredient needed to forge heroes.""You call this art?"" Indeed I do, Vulture, indeed I do."
351,"Swinging right into things, much like its predecessor, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" took me on an exhilarating cinematic journey that left my spider senses tingling from start to finish. From its first frame to the tantalizing final words of ""to be continued"" appearing on screen moments before the closing credits, the film captivated me completely.It left me speechless and wondering whether any other work of animation could ever approach its heights this year.Which, to answer you on that, the…"

353,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   feel pretty certain there are things this movie does with the concept of canon that *only* a spider-man movie can do. the shot I found most interesting was the bunch of symbiote story panels—almost every spider-man version and adaptation goes for the symbiote (and earlier and earlier in their journeys, too) and there’s no reason for it. the story is almost always the same. but the fans *demand* it. it’s a prison for spidey and—more importantly—a prison for the writers,…"
354,Keeping it at a 4.5 for now. Might change to a 5.
355,"Across the Spider-Verse takes what was good about the first Spider-Verse movie and presses the multiply button with unrelenting force. The massive scale of this picture was a bit overwhelming in comparison to the character development that these filmmakers are so expertly able to create, which didn’t serve as a benefit to the overall product.I love Gwen and I think shes probably the most interesting character in this version of the franchise. I’m so glad she got so much…"
356,"Sounds so pretentious but that was so overwhelming a cinematic experience - not just the groundbreaking and almost hallucinatory animation but the complex storytelling and wonderfully dense character development - I need to sit it with a bit and see again before truly weighing in. It’s a stunning work of art, that’s for sure. Just a LOT to take in this first time. PS: to paraphrase David Lynch, “Keep your eye on the Bagel,  not the (time)hole.”"

362,"Still one of the most visually inventive, wild and exciting things going in Hollywood right now, when it’s cooking in action sequences just thrilling, and the use of mixed styles to represent different universes is very compelling.BUT!

Get an alibi! Start “the computer club”…"
363,"Of new films I've seen recently, there aren't many that I think I've gone into with higher expectations than Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse given its rave reviews and the quality of its predecessor but even with those expectations, I was blown away by how impressive this sequel is - though it's also not a film that's without some hiccups. First off, I must admit that I don't think this one is quite on the same level as its predecessor was…"

367,"Kevin Feige, are you embarrassed? You should be.This movie is shockingly good, and it does the multiverse approximately 7,000 times better than anything the MCU has attempted over the past several years. Not trying to kick a cinematic universe when it's down, but come on.The only reason I'm docking half a star is because it has too many endings and also no actual ending—the latter of which I knew going in, so I can't be that mad. Once I've seen the trilogy in full, I may bump this up to a full five stars. It really is incredible."

Miles and Gwen get so much more development my favorite scene was them sitting upside down on the tower it was perfection. I was definitely afraid of heights in that one while momentarily feeling emotional for what's happening—a weird, but welcome mix! Spider-Punk is my favorite character addition. Awesome voice cast.

I was looking forward to this film but wasn’t super excited for it. While I love Into the Spider-Verse and view it to be good quality wise, I think it is far from the perfect masterpiece that the film community makes it out to be. I am also so disillusioned with modern cinema. If you are an avid reader of my reviewers, you would know the reason.…"
374,"The ways this film series celebrates animation by incorporating and blending so many different styles while weaving in an incredibly soundtrack will predictably be praised to the end of time, but just as important is to introduce to the world everyone's new favorite character...(mild spoilers)Hobie, who is introduced intially as one of 'those guys' who has 5 dozen different to say F the establishment.Until it is very much NOT A JOKE.

377,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The first Spider Verse movie was one that really revolutionized animation. It’s a movie that really seemed to change the game in animation and will have a place in animation history. It is now often found on lists of the greatest animated films of all time and for good reason as it’s absolutely brilliant with breathtaking animation. We all fell in love with Miles Morales and the team of Spider People/things that came with him. The characters were all memorable…

379,"At this point, Sony should stop lending Spider-Man to the MCU and make a series of animated films in the vein of Spider-Verse, because they will quickly surpass Marvel Studios. What they are doing is nothing short of remarkable, transcendent filmmaking. We are witnessing something that is once in a lifetime. Visually spectacular, story rich with conflict, and a cavalcade of characters that could never work without the grace and care of these creative geniuses. There are plenty of surprises…"
380,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant cinematic experience that shatters the boundaries of superhero storytelling. This animated gem pays homage to the iconic web slinger while introducing audiences to a multiverse of Spider People with unique powers and captivating backstories. From the very first frame, the film immerses viewers in a dazzling display of animation that blends comic book aesthetics with a modern, innovative flair. The attention to detail is astonishing, with every scene pulsating…"

I mean, probably just about everyone was expecting this, seeing just how amazing the first ""Spider-Verse"" back in 2018 was. But this one just WENT. OFF.Is it the best Spider-Man film? Mmm... Maybe! I think it depends on what you're looking for. But what really makes a movie like this so important and beloved by…"

Finally, I have witnessed the culmination of this epic cinematic journey that, regrettably, came to an end, leaving me yearning for more. To my utmost delight, this film surpassed all expectations, surpassing even its predecessor—an accomplishment that is quite rare in the realm of sequels nowadays. The anticipation for the concluding chapter, set to release in eight months…"

386,"Damn, what an amazing trip!It's honestly a fantastic and visually mind-blowing sequel. I liked the fact that it had hundreds of Spider-Men. The Spider-Rex was my favorite! I think the great animations and creative ideas are what deserve its rating. The new characters are superb, and I have grown connected to Miles and his parents, as well as Gwen. The ending was insane and it makes me even more excited for the third one.Overall, it's a very entertaining and creative sequel with excellent animations, and without a doubt, it's one of the movies that will make you enjoy it even more on rewatch."
387,the spider-verse movies are some the easiest five-star ratings i've ever given. across is a MARVELous sequel to into and set-up for beyond.
388,"Wow... Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the most movie I think I've ever seen. It's a wildly over-stimulated, hyperactive, visually stunning, hyper-kinetic, full-tilt boogie, dazzling, chaotic pieces of pop art sensory overload. And it somehow works perfectly. It could have - and probably should have - flown off the rails at any point and yet it maintained focus. It's amazing... you could even say spectacular. The flick picks up a couple years after Into the Spider-Verse. Miles has grown up…"
389,"It's a big, beautiful, exciting movie that ...doesnt' adhere to a three act structure at all. So, if you know that going in, you'll be doing gangbusters, if you don't you'll likely find this a bit frustrating. Aside from the dazzling visuals and neat reveals what makes both of these movies work is that this Miles Morales is the most likable Spider-Man ever put to screen, full stop. Shameik Moore gives an incredibly charming vocal performance that gives this whole enterprise life. Really dug it."

The first movie was already perfect but this one was already on another level.The animation is just gorgeous, is just on another level of gorgeous, the voice acting is spectacular and the story is so captivating and emotional. Maybe the most emotional Spiderman movie ever made (ok, maybe after Spiderman 2). There are so many moments that actually broke my heart.So many versions of Spiderman…"
394,"There is no doubt in any mildly-educated cinemagoer’s mind that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse pioneered a new generation of CGI animated films, with the ripples of this ingenuity canonizing itself as a mainstay in popular animated cinema even nearly five years later. The novelty of this animation has been endlessly mimicked yet never replicated, adding to the memorability of this film. Thus, it’s evident that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse cemented itself as one of the most important animated films of…"
395,"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse was easily one of my most anticipated films of the year and for a year that has this many big releases that’s really saying a ton. I absolutely adore the first film, it’s one of my favorite animated films of all time, honestly it could be my favorite. You can already see the impact the first film has made in animation since 2018, and it’s inspiring to see. However, the animation in Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse…"

397,"Making a good or better sequel is difficult, but Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse makes it look easy. Takes its boundary pushing animation even further. It’s a dynamic shockwave of colour, style and energy. Its story is incredibly bold and exciting, as Miles challenges the superhero canon in shaping his own destiny. Like no other comic book movie before it, and safe to say it may be the best. I’m excited to revisit this in the future because there were some sound…"

399,"As vibrant and visually complex as Into The Spiderverse. In some ways Across The Spiderverse inproved on the orginals visuals by adding a more impressionistic tone, particularly in Gwen’s world.The extra runtime allowed us stay in the beautiful animation for longer which is never a bad thing. Unfortunately the story and plotting weren’t as tight as the original; parts of the movie really dragged. Also, how the film chose to end its story, particularly when you take into account its extra runtime, left me feeling a little shortchanged.Overall I really enjoyed it, but there’s just something unsatisfying about how the story panned out."

This movie was specifically made for those of you with the attention span of a newborn child. It is constantly throwing its own technicolor feces at the viewer like an ape. Flashing lights, flashing lights, flashing lights, neon colors, words, words, words! If you like this, I hate you. You are mentally handicapped. You eat Fruit Loops while scrolling on TikTok and watch the latest Netflix shows…"
403,"The animated Spider-Man have somehow become better than the live action ones, and that's mostly due to the animation. This is some of the most gorgeous animation I've ever seen. It's the first time in a decade that I've felt like I'm seeing a step forward in the art of animation. It's beautiful, engaging, and helps the story. The story fairly straight forward and is mainly a set up for the next movie, but at least there's more beautiful animation to look forward to."
404,"Definitivamente, Across The Spider-Verse é uma viagem alucinante que eu jamais vou esquecer, principalmente por eu ter comido um pão de mel batizado antes de entrar no cinema, então vocês podem imaginar. Foi uma aventura e tanto!Não acho que seja o melhor filme de super herói ou a melhor animação de todos os tempos, mas é inegável a sua originalidade e genialidade por trás de toda sua complexidade e emaranhamento de “plots” e universos, parabéns para equipe responsável que…"
405,Watched 3 times now and every god damn time the audience stands up and cheers at the ending once it cuts to black. THAT’S the fuckin power of movies. Will go down as one of the all time great cinematic masterpieces. Immaculate.

415,"Visually, this is groundbreaking American pop art. Achieving a kinetic flow state that almost never slows down (for better or for worse). It’s utterly astounding to gaze at and listen too. I’m so glad I got to see it in a theater, where animation of this caliber is extremely rare. And sonically, the mix is as daring and satisfying as the visuals.The script is, I mean... it’s alright, I guess. I laughed out loud several times, the dialogue is…"
416,"They did it. Holy fucking shit, they actually did it.While I prefer Into the Spider-Verse, make no mistake, Across the Spider-Verse is ON PAR with the former. That's how much I was amazed and impressed. A first part of a sequel that's even more ambitious and experimental, with not only its gorgeous animation styles, but also with its multiversal and at times, mature storytelling (dug that Gwen gets more focus). Voice cast excels as always, but Oscar Issac is my highlight from the bunch. Pemberton's score, no words, unbelievably extraordinary.By far the best capeshit about the multiverse, alongside ITSV!"
417,Punk rock saves the day once again in a visually arresting and spectacular film clearly made for the fans. Best film of all time though?Hmm.
418,"I'm so thankful that I have got to see this on the big screen so many times this is truly the greatest animation film, the greatest Spiderman film, and dare I say one of the greatest films ever! Everything is perfect in every way the visuals are beautiful, the writing is superb, the voice acting is perfect and the music is just insane it's just all so beautiful, amazing, and spectacular in every way."
419,"So insanely good that it’s actually overwhelming.Perhaps not as streamlined as the first one just because there’s SO MUCH going on, but it still manages to be, in my opinion, considerably better. You already know the animation is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before, so I won’t focus on that.It’s heartfelt, thematically rich, and dark - yet still manages to be so much fun. This is a film for the die hard Spidey fans. At times, I felt like…"

It's a disrespect to even mention them by name in comparison to this.It is absolutely incredible how this has the excitement of an adventure but with the soothing pace of a dream-like trance. To watch a movie like this pave a way…"
422,"Holy Smokes! This movie is incredible. It's insane and probably the coolest movie I've ever seen. If you thought the original was perfect, wait until you see this one. No words can describe the emotions I was feeling. The score, the artwork, the story, the voice acting, all pitch perfect. Definitely a must-see and can’t wait for Beyond the Spider-Verse!"
423,"Movies like this are why I reject the idea that movies are ""getting worse"".Across the Spider-Verse takes everything I loved about its predecessor and makes them even better. I'm not going into spoilers, but please go see this as soon as possible.The best word I can use to describe the visuals in this film is eyegasm. This is the most visually stunning animated film I have ever seen. Every frame is a painting. Every edit is a work…"
424,"At the time of this posting, this film currently has a 4.7, which I'm pretty sure means that it will take that number 1 slot on Letterboxd's top 250 soon. We saw a similar rating last year with EEAAO. Looks like I'm in the 1% with my rating, which makes me slightly bummed that I did not enjoy it as much as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to love about this film. Like everyone is saying,…"
425,"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a perfect embodiment of everything that i look for not only in a Spider-Man film, but from a superhero film as a whole: one that captures the essence & spirit of the character to a science while also injecting it with a story and characters that you feel for throughout the runtime, thus making for both one of the best superhero AND animated films not only in recent memory, but of all time.I will start…"

Yes folks, it’s moderate curmudgeon time once again, as Hutch is lured away from the esoteric to watch a franchise movie that everyone seems to love. To be fair, I loved the first Spider-verse movie too. It was thrillingly done. But this sequel/prequel or whatever it is has lost some of the charm.

432,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I usually don’t do spoiler reviews but I had to with this one.  This would have been one of the best animated films ever if they just extended it an hour.  It is more visually stunning than the first one which I didn’t think was possible, the plot is absolutely fantastic and will take you through a rollercoaster of emotions, the comedic effects hit every time, I wasn’t able to take my eyes off the screen.  But the ending absolutely…"
433,"This was great. The stakes are raised, the visuals are next-level, but I'd still give the edge to the first one because this doesn’t quite stick the landing. Either way, the next one's set up to kick a fair amount of ass, and I'm looking forward to it."
434,a cautionary tale about the dangers of posting hole 🕳️
435,Ahhhhhh why so good??
436,"I can do both! Spider-Man always does both!Safe to say that this has been an eagerly anticipated, and possibly dreaded, film for nearly every filmgoer under the rainbow. I say the word ""dreaded"" because there could be that little creeping voice of doubt that got in the back of your head worrying that this wouldn't live up to the legacy of Into the Spider-Verse, or even, *gasp,* not even be a good movie. As you would be able to…"
437,i genuinely don’t think there’s anything i can say
438,"“You can’t have your cake and it eat it too.” “You can if you bake two cakes.” Ohhhhhhhhh these motherfuckers. They truly outdid themselves with this. I think we all expected the animation to be superb considering that Into the Spiderverse was revolutionary in that aspect, but somehow, this seemed far better. And I mean considerably better. It’s like when the world watched Avatar in 2009 and witnessed something revolutionary and then watched Way of Water last December and everyone…"
439,Never been attracted to a movie before but the animation in this was the SEXIEST THING I’VE EVER SEEN 😫Lists:2023 Ranked
440,Spider-Man in the Masterpiece of Madness. 🕷️
441,"I now know what it was like to see Snow White in 1937… It's a revelation. One of the greatest ever achievements of American animation. A work of art and artistic genius. An insane, groundbreaking feat of cinema. Sony Animation has taken the crown 👑!"
442,"What a work of art. The animation in and of itself is more than worth the price of admission. It shouldn’t be a surprise to no one, but the animation styles and visuals continue to be mind blowingly top notch. Round of applause to all the animators. This sequel’s scope is gigantic. There’s so much going on as it expands and builds on the established story. I feel that this one is even more sensory overload than the first. It…"
443,"every other minute or so i was smiling, mouthing “every frame’s a painting,” levitating out of my seat, or all three. i was G A G G E D"
444,"the best marvel movie ever. the amazing animation that really fits the theme perfectly. the humor. the story. the side characters. just perfection. the style, the action, the characters and plot line are all just perfect. not a single fault in this movie"
445,"“Bad things are gonna happen. It makes us who we are.”At some point I just have to accept that I’m not the intended audience for a movie, and that’s fine! It does feel slightly like I’m going mental when I see everyone praising it to the level they are, but to each their own.Don’t get me wrong, I think the animation is a work of art and undoubtedly impressive, but the story just never gripped me and by…"
446,"Full Chron review. Would love to dock this mostly delightful sequel points for turning, briefly, into another cameo parade, but the joke at the expense of a certain misjudged '90s story arc hit me just right. I guess we all have our point of exploitable reference."
447,"For years, I've been taking care of this little boy. Making sure he is loved. That he feels like he belongs wherever he wants to be. He wants to go on to the world and do great big things. And what I worry about most. It's just they won't look out for you like us......Wherever you go from here, you have to promise to take care of that little boy for me. Make sure he never forgets where he…"
448,This is it everyone; this is the film that won 2023. Every other movie shouldn't even try. My jaw is on the floor. This franchise is the superhero movie’s magnum opus.Absolutely spectacular from beginning to end. Across the Spider-Verse takes animation and superhero films to the next level; it's a staggering achievement of filmmaking and storytelling. Levels up on the first film in every way possible and is miles ahead of the competition. It pushes the limits of the…
449,I nearly screamed with excitement like 10 times
450,If someone asks you what the best animated movie ever made is….Remember there are only two right answers. And they both end with Spider-Verse.
451,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Spectacular Spider-Man made me cry dudeLiving on the edgeFighting crime, spinning websSwinging from the highest ledgeHe can leap above our heads"
452,"Video review on just2film: youtu.be/mzp_mrRL13UThe animation is a step up from its predecessor which already looked amazing. Very purposeful style choices and such a fun mix of various designs. Great action sequences and emotional beats thanks to its intriguing leading characters. After a tad overlong opener, I really enjoyed the story’s pacing despite this being a two-parter film. The film is literred with references but never feels like it relies solely on these nods (looking at you, Super Mario…"
453,92A monumental journey of hallucinatory animation brimming with heart and exploding colors. Absolutely staggering. This is next-level cinema in all the best ways. An electrifying sequel that bleeds emotion and transcends dimensions. It’s a kaleidoscope of creativity that seamlessly blends art and storytelling; packed with clever humor and cool characters. This shit just makes you wanna live in it. Easily one of my favorite Spider-Man films to date. Beyond hyped for the third entry.
454,I was just screaming “PLEASE DON’T END” for the final 10 minutes
455,can’t believe that 2 second clip of troy barnes wearing Spider-man pjs led to this masterpiece
456,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Thought about this some more, and talked to a friend, and I think I missed some things. This whole movie is set up to make Miles look good at the expense of everyone else. All of these Spider-Men would not be okay with the canon event stuff, that's so against what the character is all about. If Miguel is so visibly damaged and compromised as a leader and person, then why do all the other Spider-People follow him? In No…"
457,not as perfect as the first. still perfect tho.
458,"Whatever the animators were paid for this, it wasn't enough."
459,10/10. One of the best films I’ve ever seen. Uninhibited imagination. Fully understands and embraces all the best aspects of Spider-Man while exploring new layers with authenticity and cultural relevance. A tremendous feat of filmmaking. Adored it.
460,"Across The Spider-Verse is my FAVORITE movie of the year so far. Mesmerizing animation with equally elevating music. It’s truly astonishing how they not only push the boundaries of animation, but also what a Spider-Man story should be. This is a brilliant exploration of Spider-Man stories & tropes taking what fans know and love about the character and sort of braking that mold. I truly enjoyed how much more serious this film was. It really took the time to develop Miles and…"
461,"3 times in my life I've teared up in a theatre because of how beautiful a movie can look on screen, just because of visuals alone are Avatar, The Way Of Water and this. Just the first movie x100 in every single aspect. The animation, the emotions, the stakes, the music, everything.Love how ambitious they were in expanding the Spider-Verse concept introduced to us in the first movie. It's so easy for anyone making this to go beyond what…"
462,Iv waited so long to watch this and heard so much good about it. It. Did. Not. Disappoint.
463,"The MCU has been feeding us with an eyedropper, and then this just comes in with the whole kegger"
464,How does one even make something this good?Speechless. Absolutely speechless.
465,"I'M SO GLAD I AM ALIVE TO SEE THIS!I went into this film with the highest of expectations, and I don't think I was even remotely prepared for how much it would obliterate them! I'm in AWE! This has now become my favorite animated movie of all time and is, in my opinion, the best Spider-Man adaptation. I laughed, I cried, I felt everything! Animation will never be the same after this. This has now become the gold standard,…"
466,"Crowd is buzzing like at the end of INFINITY WAR, hot damn I missed that feeling…ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE is the truth. SPIDERVERSE 2 pulls narrative & thematic threads from many other definitive multiverse/inter-dimensional stories of the past & present, but does it so cohesively & distinctively thanks to the X-factors of its amazing art design and….as someone once put it, “The Exaggerated Swagger of a Black Teen”. With this latest addition, the SPIDERVERSE films are shaping up to become a definitive text of…"
467,Every so often a movie comes around that leaves me utterly speechless. I can’t form the words to describe what I’ve witnessed and thought processes cease to exist on a conscious level because there isn't enough vocabulary in the English language to express my feelings in a coherent manner. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has completely flipped my expectations as to what I should and could experience from the wonderful world of animation. It’s not just a comic book brought to…
468,These things are just on another level.Better the 2nd time.
469,"Olviden todo lo que saben de Spider-Man, de los multiversos y del cine de animación... Esta película acaba de cambiar el juego para siempre.(No hay spoilers en esta reseña)Es difícil poner en palabras lo que sentí hoy, así que empezaré diciendo que esta no solo es LA MEJOR PELÍCULA ANIMADA DEL AÑO, también es una fuerte competidora para ser para muchos y con razón, la película insignia del 2023.Tanto Miles como Gwen confirman que Spider-Man es un…"
470,"Check out my review of Across the Spiderverse on YouTube ——> HEREWho woulda thought it’s even better on rewatch! If you’re thinking about seeing this again or even for the first time, listen to the soundtrack before hand, it’s a great listen on its own, but makes the viewing experience even better!"
471,Obviously had to see it again and still it’s unbelievable 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏On the second viewing I had more time to appreciate the animation more and enjoy the film a lot more as I was so overwhelmed the first time. It’s crazy how many hints and foreshadowing there is during the film and how obvious the plot is when watching which I loved on the second viewing. I will most likely check it out for a third time in the up…
472,Seriously might be one of the best comic book movies of all time. I mean holy shit i can’t believe it.
473,The movie really spells out its message: Cops are superheroes and superheroes are cops.I suppose its less intentional albeit fitting message: The rich live in a world completely separate to us.
474,I know I only have to wait less than 10 months for Beyond the Spider-Verse to come out but forcing me to wait that long should be a crime
475,The first time was so nice I had to do it twiceEasily going to be the best film of the year and can’t wait to go watch a few more times
476,"this just might be one of the best things that happened to me in a while, I know it sounds very pretentious but it is what it is. Visually not just spectacular, beyond spectacular. Much more complex, less heart, and more terrorizing than the first part, could sense the seriousness in the writing all over the place. Very fascinating how spiderman films focus more on the heroes' flaws than their strengths, and this time loved the take on accidental superheroes.…"
477,"ESPAÑOL ~ SPANISHLuego de esperar años, meses, días, horas, minutos, segundos… Puedo decir, que vi “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”.En esta primera crítica sobre la película, no voy hacer spoilers y voy a solo mencionar 1 cosa. Voy a ser muy breve y conciso: esta es la mejor película animada que vi en mi vida. Es una experiencia de vida y tal vez es por la euforia del momento lo que estoy mencionando y en un tiempo cambie de…"
478,"Should probably drop a star or two for my AMC Theater NOT showing the full Nicole Kidman ad beforehand. Absolutely disgraceful. Luckily the movie was pretty good, surprisingly."
479,Don't even know what to say to be honest
480,"Round 2 and I’m still lost for words. Truly this generations answers to the likes of The Two Towers and The Matrix Reloaded (even throws a little bit of Dead Man’s Chest into the mix) in terms of being the sequel to an already perfect first film and taking big swings within the sequel and expands what made that first film so great to begin with, while also laying the ground work for one hell of a finale that brings…"
481,"For the second time in ten years, a Spider-Verse film proves itself to be one of the most satisfying animation spectacles ever made. I maintain envy of all of those in the future who are able to experience this film and the next in one sitting."
482,"A story that's more dramatic and emotional that explores the true meaning of being spiderman and goes deeper with miles family and his fate, has lots of Easter eggs and references that was surprising and is also very funny. It's fast paced, colorful, exciting and has superb action. There's some fun surprises and had an ending I didn't expect. The spot was briliant, perfect voice casting with Jason schwartzmann. Can't wait for whats next."
483,"I think I've become addicted to this I've watched it three times in a single day, all on opening day. It's simply perfect, beyond words!"
484,"This is almost certainly the most I've ever been disappointed by a movie that is nevertheless a clear-cut 9/10 (you will notice, though, the absence of a heart). The fact that it isn't trying at all to function as anything but the first part of an ongoing story (even Dune: Chapter One felt more like a self-contained object) isn't surprising, of course, but it's still nagging. But honestly, the bigger frustration for me is that I'm not really interested in…"
485,Enforcing the status quo simply perpetuates cycles of violence instead of preventing catastrophe. Those in power who do this instead of seeking holistic actual solutions are the enemy. Happy pride month!Full Review
486,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I've been holding back, yesterday I left the theater really bummed and I was frustrated that I just couldn't of liked it more, that I had to reign on anyone else's parade. So I took my time, I didn't rush to write a review partially out of my fear of sharing but more importantly letting the film sit so I can give it the best chance I can. Im glad I did because in the very least I can be…"
487,easiest 5 stars i’ve given in MONTHS
488,holy hell what a whirlwind of a ride from start to finish !!!!!!!!! perhaps one of the most immersive theatre experiences i've ever had.
489,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an emotionally charged exercise in maximalist animation where worlds collide and spider-people gather for a lengthy runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes that does not let up at all.Once again, from the very first frame the artistic prowess of all involved is displayed in its full colours, where the paint-like aesthetic of Gwen's world and the hyper-real visuals of the spider-people lobby are just two of the many gorgeous styles that have been…"
490,INCREDIBLE & STUNNING and if you think it doesnt deserve being #1 just cuz its animated...why do you hate fun
491,Even better a second timeThis is one of the best cinematic experiences I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching ❤️
492,"Somehow they have done it again, Sony Pictures animation, Phil Lord and Chris Miller and the rest of the team have crafted a exceptional follow up to Into the Spider Verse, a film that feels like the former on performance enhancers. Spider-Man is a story of sacrifice, sacrificing a normal life for the greater good, sacrificing the people you love for the many, and Across the Spider Verse asks why can’t you save the people you love and save everyone,…"
493,Just as strong on round 2. Unreal movie.

495,Absolutely mind blowing
496,"""Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go. Nah, I’ma do my own thing.""Voy a ser totalmente honesta como admiradora de Spiderman y sus películas, su historia y trasfondo. Fui con las expectativas muy altas, sabía que me iba a atrapar y gustar muchísimo. La combinación de animación tradicional con técnicas de animación en 3D crea un efecto único que realmente se destaca en la gran pantalla. La atención al detalle y el estilo artístico vibrante…"
497,"I know I complain about long movies sometimes, but fuck it, let's get 5 hour movies going. I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END."
498,A soaring and propulsive Spider-Man adaptation filled with groundbreaking creativity and a ton of heart. Daniel Pemberton’s fantastic score is an absolute delight and the ensemble cast of characters is entertaining and full of surprises. This a much welcomed entry in the superhero genre and the best comic book film of the year so far!
499,I didn't know this was in two parts! I can't wait for the next movie
500,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Across the Spider-Verse, shortest version:1) Okay, I knew about the cliffhanger going in, so I wasn't too thrown, and it does have that sense of 'there's no way they're going to wrap all this up' at the 90 minute mark, but still. If the third film isn't out by, say, Christmas 2025 at the latest, I'm revising my rating downwards. You can do the Empire Strikes Back thing as long as you back it up with Return of the…"
