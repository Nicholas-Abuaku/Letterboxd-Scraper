Multi-verse story telling at its finest, and even when it does lose a sense of direction, it manages to pull itself back in and regain focus.

If you’re thinking about seeing this again or even for the first time, listen to the soundtrack before hand, it’s a great listen on its own, but makes the viewing experience even better!"
0.0022797044,0.01072858,0.98699164,Obviously had to see it again and still it’s unbelievable 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏On the second viewing I had more time to appreciate the animation more and enjoy the film a lot more as I was so overwhelmed the first time. It’s crazy how many hints and foreshadowing there is during the film and how obvious the plot is when watching which I loved on the second viewing. I will most likely check it out for a third time in the up…

0.37916258,0.47086152,0.14997591,The movie really spells out its message: Cops are superheroes and superheroes are cops.I suppose its less intentional albeit fitting message: The rich live in a world completely separate to us.

0.009022951,0.031921763,0.95905524,"this just might be one of the best things that happened to me in a while, I know it sounds very pretentious but it is what it is. Visually not just spectacular, beyond spectacular. Much more complex, less heart, and more terrorizing than the first part, could sense the seriousness in the writing all over the place. Very fascinating how spiderman films focus more on the heroes' flaws than their strengths, and this time loved the take on accidental superheroes.…"

0.011327426,0.12501371,0.86365885,"Round 2 and I’m still lost for words. Truly this generations answers to the likes of The Two Towers and The Matrix Reloaded (even throws a little bit of Dead Man’s Chest into the mix) in terms of being the sequel to an already perfect first film and taking big swings within the sequel and expands what made that first film so great to begin with, while also laying the ground work for one hell of a finale that brings…"
0.0018189095,0.017426778,0.98075426,"For the second time in ten years, a Spider-Verse film proves itself to be one of the most satisfying animation spectacles ever made. I maintain envy of all of those in the future who are able to experience this film and the next in one sitting."
0.0020419196,0.014029764,0.9839283,"A story that's more dramatic and emotional that explores the true meaning of being spiderman and goes deeper with miles family and his fate, has lots of Easter eggs and references that was surprising and is also very funny. It's fast paced, colorful, exciting and has superb action. There's some fun surprises and had an ending I didn't expect. The spot was briliant, perfect voice casting with Jason schwartzmann. Can't wait for whats next."

0.9371707,0.055899512,0.0069298893,"This is almost certainly the most I've ever been disappointed by a movie that is nevertheless a clear-cut 9/10 (you will notice, though, the absence of a heart). The fact that it isn't trying at all to function as anything but the first part of an ongoing story (even Dune: Chapter One felt more like a self-contained object) isn't surprising, of course, but it's still nagging. But honestly, the bigger frustration for me is that I'm not really interested in…"
0.6390809,0.27586898,0.08505021,Enforcing the status quo simply perpetuates cycles of violence instead of preventing catastrophe. Those in power who do this instead of seeking holistic actual solutions are the enemy. Happy pride month!Full Review

I've been holding back, yesterday I left the theater really bummed and I was frustrated that I just couldn't of liked it more, that I had to reign on anyone else's parade. So I took my time, I didn't rush to write a review partially out of my fear of sharing but more importantly letting the film sit so I can give it the best chance I can. Im glad I did because in the very least I can be…"

0.005782421,0.117340386,0.8768772,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an emotionally charged exercise in maximalist animation where worlds collide and spider-people gather for a lengthy runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes that does not let up at all.Once again, from the very first frame the artistic prowess of all involved is displayed in its full colours, where the paint-like aesthetic of Gwen's world and the hyper-real visuals of the spider-people lobby are just two of the many gorgeous styles that have been…"

0.10987113,0.46141967,0.4287092,"Somehow they have done it again, Sony Pictures animation, Phil Lord and Chris Miller and the rest of the team have crafted a exceptional follow up to Into the Spider Verse, a film that feels like the former on performance enhancers. Spider-Man is a story of sacrifice, sacrificing a normal life for the greater good, sacrificing the people you love for the many, and Across the Spider Verse asks why can’t you save the people you love and save everyone,…"

Across the Spider-Verse, shortest version:1) Okay, I knew about the cliffhanger going in, so I wasn't too thrown, and it does have that sense of 'there's no way they're going to wrap all this up' at the 90 minute mark, but still. If the third film isn't out by, say, Christmas 2025 at the latest, I'm revising my rating downwards. You can do the Empire Strikes Back thing as long as you back it up with Return of the…"
