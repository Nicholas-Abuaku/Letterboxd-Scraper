Scrapes letterboxd reviews and performs sentiment analysis 
Start by pasting letterboxd review page, for example: "https://letterboxd.com/film/about-time/reviews/"
As of this current version, everything is running on the main thread so the program will freeze when performing sentiment analysis and scraping the web.
Output of files is a little messy right now, will fix in the next update
